Octane is a fast, TypeScript-first UI framework — the successor to
[Inferno](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno), the React-like library built to
stay close to the speed of hand-written DOM code. Octane keeps that goal and
modernizes everything around it: you write with the React API you already know,
but a compiler removes the virtual DOM, Suspense waterfalls, rules-of-hooks
bookkeeping, and hand-maintained dependency arrays before your app ships.

If you know React, you already know Octane. `useState`, `useEffect`, `memo`,
context, portals, Suspense, transitions — same API, same mental model, checked
the boring way against a large behavioral test suite. React-derived coverage is
tracked case-by-case in the generated
[React parity coverage report](./docs/react-parity-coverage.md), rather than
inferred from the size of the whole suite. Your React knowledge just works.

Speed was never going to be enough on its own, though. The reason to reach for
Octane is the day-to-day feel:

- **Write the JSX you already write.** Standard `.tsx`/`.jsx` runs out of the
  box — paste a component from the React docs and it works, hooks and all.
- **Or opt into `.tsrx` for more.** TSRX is the spiritual successor to JSX: the
  same mental model, plus template directives (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`, `@try`)
  that compile to keyed fast paths, and an `@{ … }` shorthand that lets setup sit
  right next to the output. Mix both dialects in one app and import freely across
  the boundary — you choose per component.
- **Write the closure, not its dependency list.** Omit the array from
  `useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`, `useInsertionEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`,
  or `useImperativeHandle` and the compiler derives it from lexical captures,
  including knowledge of stable setters, dispatchers, refs, state getters, and
  effect events. It is the no-bookkeeping dependency DX associated with signal
  frameworks, while keeping the hooks model you already know. Explicit arrays
  remain authoritative; pass `null` when you intentionally want every render.
- **No rules of hooks.** Hooks are tracked by call site, not call order, so a
  hook can live inside an `if` or after an early return — the usual React
  footguns simply aren't there. The one rule that remains is enforced for you:
  a hook in a plain JS loop is a compile error (every iteration would share one
  call-site slot) — loop with the keyed `@for` directive instead, where each
  item gets its own hook state.
- **The platform, not a reimplementation of it.** Real delegated DOM events,
  controlled form components on native events (React's `value`/`checked`
  semantics — `onInput` per keystroke, no synthetic `onChange`), and
  refs-as-props (`ref={cb}`, `ref={obj}`, even `ref={[a, b]}`) — no synthetic
  layer second-guessing the browser.
- **No virtual DOM.** Components re-render like React, but a compiled render path
  and a LIS-based keyed reconciler keep the runtime overhead minimal.

## Status

Octane is currently in alpha development.

The core suite contains **3,500+ distinct behavioral tests** across conformance,
differential, hydration, runtime, compiler, and SSR coverage. The `octane-prod`
project reruns the normal suite against the production compiler path, so those
executions are valuable mode coverage but are not counted again as unique tests.
This is an Octane suite count, not a claim that every test was ported from React;
the exact pinned snapshot and source-attributed React counts come from the
[coverage ledger and report](./docs/react-parity-coverage.md).

## At a glance

- **The full React hook API** — `useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useRef`,
  `useId`, `useTransition`, `useDeferredValue`, `use`, and the rest — with the
  same effect ordering and Suspense semantics, plus compiler-inferred dependency
  lists when you omit them.
- **Fully async** — transitions, deferred values, and `<Activity>`.
- **Streaming SSR and byte-stable hydration** — out-of-order Suspense flushing
  over Node or web streams, or buffered/static rendering when you want it.
- **Errors handled two ways** — the `<ErrorBoundary>` component, or `@try` /
  `@catch` in TSRX.
- **`class` / `className` composes clsx-style** everywhere — strings, arrays,
  objects, and nesting, at every apply site.
- **Refs as props**, including array composition (`ref={[a, b]}`) — no
  `forwardRef`. Works with spreads, SSR, and hydration.
- **Controlled form components on native events** — `value`/`checked` follow
  React's controlled semantics exactly; `defaultValue`/`defaultChecked` opt out.
  The per-keystroke handler is the native `onInput` (no synthetic `onChange`).

Octane is deliberately narrow where React has grown wide: **no class components,
no Server Components, no synthetic event system.** Those are choices, not gaps —
see [Differences from React](https://octanejs.dev/docs/differences-from-react).

## Quick start

### Install

Octane's published packages require Node.js 22 or newer.

```bash
pnpm add octane @octanejs/vite-plugin
```

For any Vite app, add Octane's Vite integration:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import { octane } from '@octanejs/vite-plugin';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [octane()],
});
```

Without `octane.config.ts`, the plugin compiles a normal client-only SPA and
preserves Vite's standard HTML handling. Add an Octane config with routes to
activate routing, streaming SSR, hydration, and client/server production builds.

Octane also supports Rspack and Rsbuild 2.x. Use the low-level Rspack plugin
when you own the application shell and entries yourself:

```bash
pnpm add -D @rspack/core @octanejs/rspack-plugin
```

```js
// rspack.config.mjs
import { OctaneRspackPlugin } from '@octanejs/rspack-plugin';

export default {
  entry: './src/main.tsrx',
  plugins: [new OctaneRspackPlugin()],
};
```

Use the Rsbuild plugin for the full Octane app layer: routing, streaming dev
SSR, hydration entries, client/server production environments, preview, and
deployment adapters.

```bash
pnpm add @octanejs/rsbuild-plugin
pnpm add -D @rsbuild/core
```

```ts
// rsbuild.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@rsbuild/core';
import { pluginOctane } from '@octanejs/rsbuild-plugin';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [pluginOctane()],
});
```

The same `@octanejs/vite-plugin` setup above provides these app-level features
for Vite. See the
[build tools guide](https://octanejs.dev/docs/build-tools) for SPA, SSR,
client/server target, HMR, and config examples.

Pass `profile: true` to the Vite, Rspack, or Rsbuild integration to create a
client profiling build with component timing, render counts and causes,
schedule-to-render delay, Chrome Performance tracks, and a bounded console API.
Normal production builds omit the compiler metadata and tree-shake the recorder
unless application code imports `octane/profiling` directly. See the
[profiling guide](https://octanejs.dev/docs/profiling).

Production client compilation automatically reuses conservative same-module
pure component regions and keyed lists by inferred lexical dependencies, using
React-Compiler-style strict-identity snapshots and the normal context-aware
Block/keyed-list machinery. There is nothing to configure and no flag to
learn: the proof fails closed, so HMR, dev, profiling, and server builds use
normal reconciliation, and effects, refs, mutable ambient reads, custom
comparators, and Suspense/transition boundaries keep their authored
every-render behavior. Caching render-used imported calculations and their
descriptor output is a later phase that ships together with per-key descriptor
reuse.

### Mount

```ts
// main.ts
import { createRoot } from 'octane';
import { App } from './App.tsrx';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!);
root.render(App, { title: 'Hello world!' });
```

### Server render and hydrate

Octane's SSR entry points mirror React's, so this maps onto what you already do.
`octane/server` is the request-time renderer (React's `react-dom/server`) — pick
buffered (`renderToString`) or streaming (`renderToPipeableStream` /
`renderToReadableStream`); `octane/static` is the static-generation renderer
(`react-dom/static`). Buffered renders hand back `{ html, css }` — hoisted
`<title>`/`<meta>`/`<link>` fold into `html` (as in React 19), and `css` is the
deduped scoped-`<style>` tags, which the client's `injectStyle` matches on
hydration so styles cross the boundary exactly once.

```ts
// entry-server.ts
import { renderToString } from 'octane/server'; // sync; fallbacks for suspended boundaries
import { prerender } from 'octane/static'; // async; awaits all Suspense data
import { App } from './App.tsrx';

export async function renderApp() {
  const { html, css } = await prerender(App); // { html, css }
  return { html, css };
}
```

| API | Module | Await | Suspense boundary that suspends |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `renderToString(el, props?, opts?)` | `octane/server` | no (sync) | renders its `@pending` fallback |
| `renderToStaticMarkup(el, props?, opts?)` | `octane/server` | no (sync) | fallback; **no** hydration markers/seeds |
| `renderToPipeableStream(el, props?, opts?)` | `octane/server` | streams | shell ships the fallback; boundary streams in when it settles |
| `renderToReadableStream(el, props?, opts?)` | `octane/server` | streams | shell ships the fallback; boundary streams in when it settles |
| `prerender(el, props?, opts?)` | `octane/static` | yes | awaits data, renders the success arm |

The buffered/static renderers accept a `RenderOptions` (CSP `nonce`, a root-local
`identifierPrefix`, an `AbortSignal`, and a per-render `timeoutMs`). See
[docs/ssr.md](./docs/ssr.md) for the full server guide (Suspense on the server,
head hoisting, `module server` RPC) and the SSR roadmap.

### Streaming SSR

This is the fast-first-paint story, and it works the way React's does.
`renderToPipeableStream` (Node streams) and `renderToReadableStream` (web streams)
flush a **shell** immediately — the full page, with `@pending` fallbacks standing
in for anything still suspended — so the browser paints without waiting on your
slowest data. Each Suspense boundary then streams in **out of order** the moment
its data settles, as a hidden segment plus a tiny inline swap script. When the
client hydrates, `hydrateRoot` adopts the swapped-in DOM byte-for-byte, per-boundary
`use()` seeds included — no re-render, no flash.

```ts
// entry-server.ts (Node)
import { renderToPipeableStream } from 'octane/server';
import { App } from './App.tsrx';

export function renderApp(res) {
  const { pipe } = renderToPipeableStream(App, undefined, {
    onShellReady() {
      res.statusCode = 200;
      res.setHeader('content-type', 'text/html');
      pipe(res); // shell flushes now; boundaries stream in behind it
    },
    onShellError(err) {
      res.statusCode = 500;
      res.end('<!doctype html>Server error');
    },
  });
}
```

`renderToReadableStream` returns a `Promise<ReadableStream<Uint8Array>>` that
resolves once the shell is ready (rejects on a shell error). It is pull-driven,
honors consumer cancellation, and carries an `allReady` promise that settles
when every boundary chunk has been accepted under backpressure; consume the
stream concurrently rather than awaiting `allReady` before reading. The Node
stream honors `write(false)`/`drain` and cancels on destination error or close.
Both accept a `StreamOptions` (`RenderOptions` plus `onShellReady()`,
`onShellError(err)`, and `onAllReady()`). The Vite and Rsbuild metaframework
plugins render through `renderToReadableStream` by default.

```ts
// entry-client.ts
import { hydrateRoot } from 'octane';
import { App } from './App.tsrx';

hydrateRoot(document.getElementById('app')!, App);
```

## Core syntax

### Components

A component is any function you use at a `<Foo/>` site — there's no separate
"component" declaration. A function renders whatever it returns: a JSX root, a
primitive (coerced to text), `null`, or an array. `@{ … }` is simply shorthand
for returning JSX — `function f() @{ … }` desugars to `function f() { … return
<jsx> }` — so hooks and locals can sit next to the output (the `@{ … }` scope ends
with one output node, a JSX element or a fragment). Both forms compile
identically, and any function can use either.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'octane';

export function Counter() @{
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
    {'Count: ' + count}
  </button>
}
```

The same component written with an explicit `return` is identical — and a
function is free to return a non-JSX value, which is coerced like any renderable:

```jsx
export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{'Count: ' + count}</button>;
}

function Label(props) {
  if (props.hidden) return null; // renders nothing
  return props.text; // a string renders as text
}
```

### State and effects

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'octane';

export function Timer() @{
  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => setSeconds((s) => s + 1), 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  });

  <p>{'Elapsed: ' + seconds}</p>
}
```

Dependency arrays are optional in Octane. When one is omitted from
`useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`, `useInsertionEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`,
or `useImperativeHandle`, the compiler derives it from the callback's reactive
captures. It understands member reads and stable hook results such as state
setters, reducer dispatchers, refs, and state getters. It also omits
`useEffectEvent` results because Effect Events are non-reactive captures, even
though React-compatible wrappers have a fresh identity on each render.

Explicit arrays keep their React meaning and are never rewritten. Pass `null`
for the uncommon every-render form:

```jsx
useEffect(() => sync(room.id)); // inferred from the closure
useEffect(() => initialize(), []); // explicitly mount/reconnect only
useEffect(() => sync(room.id), [room.id]); // explicit dependencies
useEffect(() => measure(), null); // explicitly after every commit
```

`useState` and `useReducer` also expose an optional third tuple member: a stable getter for
the hook's latest state. It is useful in async callbacks and other long-lived
closures where capturing the render's state value would go stale:

```jsx
export function SaveButton() @{
  const [draft, setDraft, getDraft] = useState('');

  const saveLater = async () => {
    await waitForConnection();
    await save(getDraft()); // the latest draft, not the render that started this callback
  };

  <button onClick={saveLater}>{'Save ' + draft}</button>
}
```

The compiler emits a getter-enabled hook only when the third tuple member can
be observed. Ordinary `[state, setState]` and `[state, dispatch]` destructures
keep the existing two-item runtime path and allocate no getter. Escaped or
ambiguous tuples conservatively receive the complete three-item shape. The
getter reads the latest scheduled hook value, which may be newer than the
currently committed DOM during a pending render.

### Conditional hooks

Unlike React, a hook can sit behind a guard or after an early `return`:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'octane';

export function Panel(props) @{
  const [n, setN] = useState(0);

  // An early return before a hook is fine in octane. Each hook call site has a
  // stable compiler-assigned slot, so render order can't desync the hooks.
  if (props.hidden) return;

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('n changed:', n);
  });

  <button onClick={() => setN(n + 1)}>{'count: ' + n}</button>
}
```

### Control flow

Rendered control flow uses directive-prefixed blocks: `@if`, `@for`, `@switch`,
and `@try`. Plain JavaScript control flow stays in setup code.

```jsx
export function Feed(props) @{
  <ul>
    @for (const item of props.items; key item.id) {
      <li>{item.title as string}</li>
    } @empty {
      <li>Nothing to show</li>
    }
  </ul>
}
```

```jsx
export function Greeting(props) @{
  @if (props.name) {
    <p>{'Hello, ' + props.name}</p>
  } @else {
    <p>Hello, stranger</p>
  }
}
```

### Class composition

`class` (and its alias `className`) accepts more than a string. Octane composes the
value the same way the `clsx` / `classnames` libraries do — from strings, numbers,
arrays, objects, and any nesting of those — so you can build a class list inline
without a helper. Falsy parts (`false`, `0`, `null`, `undefined`, `''`) drop out;
object keys are kept when their value is truthy.

```jsx
export function Button(props) @{
  <button
    class={[
      'btn',
      props.size,                       // 'btn lg'
      { active: props.active, disabled: props.disabled },
      props.extra,                      // string | array | object | falsy
    ]}
  >
    {props.label as string}
  </button>
}
```

Composition is native to the runtime (no dependency) and works everywhere a class
does: dynamic bindings, `{...spread}` props, SVG elements, scoped-`<style>` components
(the scope hash is appended after your classes), and server rendering (the SSR output
and client render compose byte-identically, so hydration never mismatches).

> Unlike React — which coerces `className={['a', 'b']}` to the string `"a,b"` — this is
> a deliberate Octane convenience. A plain string still takes the fast path.

## Documentation

The full docs live at **[octanejs.dev](https://octanejs.dev)**, a site built with
Octane itself. Good places to start:

- **[Quick start](https://octanejs.dev/docs/quick-start)** — install, mount, and
  the `.tsrx` essentials.
- **[Build tools](https://octanejs.dev/docs/build-tools)** — configure Vite,
  Rspack, or Rsbuild for SPA compilation and full-stack SSR.
- **[TSRX vs TSX/JSX](https://octanejs.dev/docs/tsrx-vs-tsx)** — when to reach for
  each dialect and exactly what TSRX unlocks: compiled `@for` collections,
  template control flow, and text holes.
- **[Differences from React](https://octanejs.dev/docs/differences-from-react)** —
  the deliberate divergences, and why everything else matching React is the point.
- **[Bindings](https://octanejs.dev/docs/bindings)** — the `@octanejs/*` ports of
  the React ecosystem.

## Packages

This is a pnpm monorepo containing the core runtime+compiler, the metaframework
plugin (and its Vercel adapter), an MCP server, private evaluation tooling, and
the framework bindings. The current workspace package inventory and counts are
generated from the workspace manifests in
[`docs/packages.md`](./docs/packages.md):

- [`octane`](./packages/octane) is the runtime and the compiler together. It covers
  rendering, the hook API, the server (SSR) and client (hydration) entry points,
  and the compiler itself, exposed at `octane/compiler` with bundler adapters at
  `octane/compiler/vite` and `octane/compiler/bundler`.
- [`@octanejs/app-core`](./packages/app-core) contains the bundler-neutral app
  config, routing, SSR, hydration code generation, and production handler used
  by the metaframework integrations.
- [`@octanejs/rspack-plugin`](./packages/rspack-plugin-octane) is the low-level
  Rspack compiler integration; [`@octanejs/rsbuild-plugin`](./packages/rsbuild-plugin-octane)
  is the full Rsbuild metaframework integration.
- [`@octanejs/vite-plugin`](./packages/vite-plugin-octane) is the recommended
  integration for every Vite app: compiler integration for SPAs, plus dev SSR,
  routing, hydration, and production server builds when app routes are configured;
  [`@octanejs/adapter-vercel`](./packages/adapter-vercel) deploys its build
  output to Vercel.
- [`@octanejs/mcp-server`](./packages/octane-mcp-server) exposes octane docs and
  compile tooling to AI agents over MCP.
- [`@octanejs/evals`](./packages/octane-evals) is the private workspace package
  for standalone Octane application prompts, starter workspaces, behavioral
  graders, public reference implementations, and reproducible evaluation
  tooling. It measures framework use rather than monorepo repair. Active
  held-out material stays outside the repository.
- The bi-directional React bridge:
  [`@octanejs/react-compat`](./packages/react-compat) runs unmodified React packages
  **on Octane** (out of the box, via `octane({ compat: [react()] })`), and
  [`@octanejs/react-wrapper`](./packages/react-wrapper) mounts Octane components
  **inside a React app** for incremental adoption.
- The `@octanejs/*` framework bindings — each an octane port of a React library,
  the native performance option next to `react-compat`'s out-of-the-box path:
  [`zustand`](./packages/zustand), [`jotai`](./packages/jotai),
  [`ai`](./packages/tanstack-ai), [`query`](./packages/tanstack-query),
  [`store`](./packages/tanstack-store),
  [`form`](./packages/tanstack-form), [`apollo-client`](./packages/apollo-client),
  [`motion`](./packages/motion),
  [`stylex`](./packages/stylex), [`router`](./packages/tanstack-router),
  [`remix-router`](./packages/remix-router),
  [`table`](./packages/tanstack-table), [`virtual`](./packages/tanstack-virtual),
  [`lexical`](./packages/lexical), [`floating-ui`](./packages/floating-ui),
  [`radix`](./packages/radix), [`hook-form`](./packages/hook-form),
  [`base-ui`](./packages/base-ui), [`sonner`](./packages/sonner),
  [`recharts`](./packages/recharts), [`visx`](./packages/visx),
  [`three`](./packages/three),
  [`lucide`](./packages/lucide),
  [`redux`](./packages/redux), [`redux-toolkit`](./packages/redux-toolkit),
  [`testing-library`](./packages/testing-library),
  [`i18next`](./packages/i18next), and [`mdx`](./packages/mdx).
  Parity varies by package — some are behaviorally complete, others are
  explicitly partial or alpha. [`docs/bindings-status.md`](./docs/bindings-status.md)
  is the generated per-package status table (upstream version, supported
  surface, known divergences, SSR/hydration, last evidence check), sourced
  from each package's `status.json` and checked in CI.

## Development

Octane uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) for package management and workspace scripts.

```bash
pnpm install      # install workspace dependencies
pnpm test         # run the test suite
pnpm typecheck    # type-check packages, website, and examples
pnpm format       # format with Prettier
```

### Playground

The playground under [`playground/octane`](./playground/octane) covers state, keyed
lists, conditional rendering, `@switch`, dynamic components, and suspense:

```bash
pnpm --filter octane-playground dev
```

### Product examples

The applications under [`examples/`](./examples) are runnable demonstrations
and Playwright-backed regression fixtures. Validate their manifests, tooling
contracts, strict TypeScript support code, and production builds with
`pnpm examples:check`; run their browser journeys with `pnpm examples:e2e`.
