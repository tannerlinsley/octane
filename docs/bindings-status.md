# @octanejs/\* bindings status (generated)

<!-- GENERATED FILE — do not edit. Edit packages/<name>/status.json and
     regenerate with `pnpm bindings:status`. -->

The central status table for the 33 `@octanejs/*` framework bindings.
Each row is sourced from that package's `packages/<name>/status.json` — the
machine-readable status block maintained next to the code it describes — merged
with the version in its `package.json`. CI runs `pnpm bindings:status:check`,
so a scope change that isn't reflected here fails the build.

The bindings deliberately sit at different maturity levels: some have broad
differential evidence against the real React library, others are thin bindings
over a framework-agnostic core, and some are explicitly partial or alpha. "Last
checked" records when the stated scope and its supporting evidence were most
recently reviewed. It does **not** certify full semantic parity outside the
supported surface and known test coverage described for that package.

| Package | Ports | Supported surface | Known divergences | SSR / hydration | Last checked |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`@octanejs/apollo-client`](#octanejsapollo-client) | `@apollo/client@4.2.6` | Complete published client adapter surface: all 18 @apollo/client/react runtime exports and their Apollo 4.2.6 TypeScript declarations, plus the framework-neutral root/testing exports and an Octane MockedProvider. | Suspense unwraps stable Apollo promises through Octane use() instead of React's use() or a thrown-promise fallback; The React class-based MockedProvider is an equivalent Octane function component; React Server Components and Apollo's React Compiler-generated entry are intentionally not exposed | Core hooks use Octane's server hook implementations, but Apollo's multi-pass non-Suspense query prepass, cache extraction/restore integration, and dedicated SSR/hydration tests remain open. | 2026-07-14 |
| [`@octanejs/aria`](#octanejsaria) | `react-aria@3.50.0` | Phases 0-1 complete: the utils foundation, SSR utilities, the complete interactions area (usePress, useHover, focus/keyboard family, useLongPress, useMove, Pressable/PressResponder), the focus area (FocusScope with containment/restore/focus managers, FocusRing, useFocusRing, useHasTabbableChild), the i18n area (I18nProvider, locale/collator/formatter/filter hooks), form validation (useFormValidation + stately useFormValidationState), and the leaf hooks: useButton/useToggleButton(+Group), useLabel/useField, useCheckbox(+Group/+Item), useRadio/useRadioGroup, useSwitch, useTextField, useSearchField, useProgressBar, useMeter, useSeparator, useLink, useDisclosure, useToolbar, VisuallyHidden — plus the matching react-stately state hooks under `@octanejs/aria/stately`. Differential-verified byte-identical against the real react-aria (interactions + button/toggle/checkbox/switch/radio/textfield/progress fixtures). Collections, overlays, and react-aria-components are not started — see the migration plan. | Text-input DOM wiring uses octane's native `onInput` (per keystroke) instead of React's synthetic `onChange`; React Aria's public value-level `onChange(value)` callbacks are unchanged; `forwardRef` becomes octane's ref-as-prop; i18n server serializer: hoisted-string variable names stay valid identifiers past 26 entries (upstream's `common.size + 97` yields `{`, `\|`, … — a SyntaxError in the emitted inline script); useDefaultLocale, SSR branch: `direction` derives from the server-injected locale via `isRTL` (upstream hardcodes 'ltr' even for an injected RTL locale, disagreeing with its own getDefaultLocale) | Not yet covered (planned for Phase 8; see the migration plan). | 2026-07-17 |
| [`@octanejs/base-ui`](#octanejsbase-ui) | `@base-ui/react@1.6.0` | Alpha, in progress: the foundation + overlay infrastructure and the first component set (Dialog, AlertDialog, Popover open-path) landed, ported at full fidelity and differential-verified against the real `@base-ui/react`. | Handlers receive native DOM events (no synthetic layer); `forwardRef` becomes ref-as-prop; `className` composes via octane's `normalizeClass` (the render-prop string merge matches Base UI exactly) | No dedicated SSR/hydration tests yet. | 2026-07-08 |
| [`@octanejs/dexie`](#octanejsdexie) | `dexie-react-hooks@4.4.0` | Port of the public dexie-react-hooks surface: useObservable, useLiveQuery, useSuspendingObservable, useSuspendingLiveQuery, usePermissions, and useDocument, with Dexie's framework-neutral API re-exported from the package root. | Suspending hooks integrate with Octane's use() rather than React's use() or thrown-promise implementation details; Hook call-site slots are forwarded through Octane's compiler binding ABI; useDocument requires consumers to install and import y-dexie and yjs before using the hook; those integrations remain optional | Supported for non-suspending live queries: SSR returns the configured default without opening IndexedDB, and hydration adopts the server host before replacing the default with live data. Suspending live queries remain client-oriented and do not claim server data loading. | 2026-07-16 |
| [`@octanejs/dnd-kit`](#octanejsdnd-kit) | `@dnd-kit/react@0.5.0` | Complete modern dnd-kit React-adapter surface: DragDropProvider, DragOverlay, useDraggable/useDroppable, manager/monitor/operation hooks, PointerSensor/KeyboardSensor re-exports, the public signal-hook utilities, useSortable, and all four upstream entry points. | DragOverlay distinguishes octane compiled children blocks from function render props; ordinary typed usage is behaviorally equivalent; useSortable retains the upstream keyboard plugin by default but omits OptimisticSortingPlugin because moving one host element before application state commits can split an Octane keyed DOM range; explicit plugin arrays remain authoritative | Static SSR and hydration are covered; DOM plugins initialize only after client refs register. | 2026-07-15 |
| [`@octanejs/floating-ui`](#octanejsfloating-ui) | `@floating-ui/react@0.27.19` | Positioning (`useFloating`, ref-aware `arrow`, the `@floating-ui/dom` middleware re-exports, the floating tree), the full interaction-hook set (`useInteractions`, `useHover` + `safePolygon`, `useClick`, `useFocus`, `useDismiss`, `useRole`, `useClientPoint`, `useListNavigation`, `useTypeahead`), the component layer (`FloatingPortal`, `FloatingOverlay`, `FloatingFocusManager`, `FloatingArrow`, `FloatingList`, `Composite`), and transitions + `FloatingDelayGroup`. | `forwardRef` becomes octane's ref-as-prop | No dedicated SSR/hydration tests. | 2026-07-05 |
| [`@octanejs/hook-form`](#octanejshook-form) | `react-hook-form@7.81.0` | Complete port of react-hook-form 7.81.0 (upstream commit b7df98c2) with the upstream test suite ported: `useForm`, `useController`, `useFieldArray`, `useFormState`, `useWatch`, `useFormContext`/`FormProvider`, schema resolvers, and all validation modes. | `register()` returns `onInput` (octane's native per-keystroke event) instead of React's synthetic `onChange`; mode names and `register` option keys keep the upstream spelling; Ported tests directly assert Octane's documented microtask-flush commit granularity, eager `Object.is` setState bailout, and native input-event delivery; the suite contains no skipped or expected-failure cases | Supported and tested — the upstream `*.server.test.tsx` suite runs via `octane/server` with byte-identical markup. | 2026-07-14 |
| [`@octanejs/i18next`](#octanejsi18next) | `react-i18next@17.0.9` | Complete runtime port of react-i18next 17.0.9: useTranslation, I18nextProvider/context, Trans/TransWithoutContext, IcuTrans/IcuTransWithoutContext, Translation, the withTranslation/withSSR HOCs, useSSR, namespace reporting, initialization/default helpers, and the root ICU helper exports over the unchanged i18next core. | Trans children that must be inspected are passed in prop position (`children={<>…</>}`) or through `defaults` + `components`; natural .tsrx block children are opaque compiled render bodies and fall back with a development warning; Suspense uses octane's `use(thenable)` instead of throwing a Promise; withTranslation's `withRef` option uses octane's ref-as-prop model; class components are unsupported; The React/Babel-specific `icu.macro` subpath is not shipped; the runtime IcuTrans APIs are fully supported | Preloaded renderToString output and namespace collection are covered; useSSR, withSSR, getInitialProps, and composeInitialProps are ported. A dedicated hydration differential is still open. | 2026-07-13 |
| [`@octanejs/jotai`](#octanejsjotai) | `jotai@2.20.1` | Complete 1:1 port: the framework-agnostic vanilla core (`jotai/vanilla`, `/vanilla/utils`, `/vanilla/internals`) is reused verbatim; the React layer (`Provider`, `useStore`, `useAtom`, `useAtomValue`, `useSetAtom`) and `react/utils` (`useResetAtom`, `useReducerAtom`, `useAtomCallback`, `useHydrateAtoms`) are ported onto octane hooks, preserving upstream's useReducer force-update + effect-subscription implementation, async atoms via octane's `use()`. | `jotai/babel/*` (React-specific compile-time plugins) is not shipped | No SSR-specific surface; `useHydrateAtoms` is ported and usable for hydration seeding; no dedicated SSR tests. | 2026-07-11 |
| [`@octanejs/lexical`](#octanejslexical) | `@lexical/react@0.46.0` | 35 of 39 `@lexical/react` modules ported: composer + contexts, the editable surface, plain/rich text, and the full plugin/menu set (history, lists + check-list, links, tables, markdown shortcuts, the typeahead/node-menu/context-menu family, draggable-block, character-limit, …) plus the `useLexical*` hooks. | Positioning uses `@floating-ui/dom` instead of `@floating-ui/react`; The class-based `LexicalErrorBoundary` becomes an octane error boundary; `forwardRef` becomes ref-as-prop | No dedicated SSR/hydration tests. | 2026-07-09 |
| [`@octanejs/lucide`](#octanejslucide) | `lucide-react@1.24.0` | Complete against the published `lucide-react@1.24.0` runtime surface: every canonical icon and alias, the `icons` namespace, `Icon`, `createLucideIcon`, `LucideProvider`, `useLucideContext`, `DynamicIcon`, `iconNames`, `dynamicIconImports`, and per-icon subpath imports. | Icon refs are normal Octane `ref` props rather than React `forwardRef` components; Event callbacks receive native DOM events rather than React synthetic events | Supported and tested: icons and provider defaults render through `octane/server`, and client hydration adopts the server-rendered SVG element. | 2026-07-13 |
| [`@octanejs/mdx`](#octanejsmdx) | `@mdx-js/mdx@3.1.1` | The full compile-don't-interpret pipeline: `.mdx`/`.md` → `@mdx-js/mdx` (reused verbatim) → octane compiler, via the `octaneMdx()` Vite plugin plus the `./compile` and `./server` entries; `@mdx-js/react`'s provider layer (`MDXProvider`/`useMDXComponents`) is ported onto octane context. The octane website runs on it. | `useMDXComponents` drops upstream's `useMemo` referential-stability wrapper so the call is valid in both server and client runtimes (same observable mapping) | Full SSR + hydration coverage — server-compiled documents render via `renderToString` and hydrate byte-for-byte (`ssr.test.ts`, `hydration.test.ts`). | 2026-07-07 |
| [`@octanejs/motion`](#octanejsmotion) | `motion@12.40.0` | Core surface: `motion.<tag>` (animate, gestures, variants with propagation/stagger, drag, layout basics), `AnimatePresence`, `MotionConfig`, and the motion-value hooks (`useMotionValue`, `useScroll`, `useTransform`, `useSpring`, `useAnimate`, `useMotionValueEvent`); motion-dom's animation engine and gesture primitives are reused verbatim. | Exit animations run via cleanup-before-detach instead of React's deferred-deletion machinery; `layout`/`layoutId` use single-element FLIP, not the full projection tree | No SSR-specific surface; no dedicated SSR tests. | 2026-07-06 |
| [`@octanejs/radix`](#octanejsradix) | `radix-ui@1.6.1` | Complete against the unified `radix-ui@1.6.1` component surface — all primitives (incl. Dialog, the Menu/DropdownMenu/ContextMenu family, Popover, Tooltip, Select, NavigationMenu, Toast, Menubar, Slider, the form controls, and OneTimePasswordField/PasswordToggleField) plus the composition/state/overlay foundations — verified by a differential suite (same fixtures through octane and the real radix-ui, byte-identical DOM). | `Slot`/`asChild` compose element descriptors (prop-position JSX, `createElement`, `.map()` returns), not children-position JSX; `forwardRef` becomes octane's ref-as-prop | SSR/hydration coverage for the overlay/portal components is still open (tracked in the migration plan). | 2026-07-08 |
| [`@octanejs/recharts`](#octanejsrecharts) | `recharts@3.9.2` | Partial (phases 0–1 of 5): the static `BarChart`/`LineChart` pipeline end-to-end (`isAnimationActive={false}`), byte-identical to upstream in the differential rig; the Redux/RTK state layer, `Surface`/`Layer`, and the pure shape set are in place. | Chart events coordinate through octane's native delegated events rather than React's synthetic layer | Untested; text measurement (`getStringSize`) returns 0×0 under SSR. | 2026-07-07 |
| [`@octanejs/redux`](#octanejsredux) | `react-redux@9.3.0` | The hooks + `Provider` surface of react-redux 9.3.0 (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`, `useStore`, and the custom-context factory variants) on octane's `useSyncExternalStore`; works with any Redux 5 / Redux Toolkit store. Export parity is pinned by test. | `connect()` (the legacy HOC surface) intentionally throws — the hooks API is the supported surface; Error messages are octane-branded | No SSR-specific surface; no dedicated SSR tests. | 2026-07-08 |
| [`@octanejs/redux-toolkit`](#octanejsredux-toolkit) | `@reduxjs/toolkit@2.12.0` | Complete four-entry-point port: the framework-agnostic Toolkit and RTK Query core are re-exported verbatim; `/query/react` provides generated query, lazy-query, mutation, infinite-query, prefetch hooks and `ApiProvider`; `/react` provides the dynamic-middleware dispatch-hook integration. | The compatibility `/react` subpaths and `reactHooksModule` names are retained, but use octane and `@octanejs/redux` internally; `useDebugValue` is octane's no-op compatibility hook; observable query behavior is unchanged | Preloaded RTK Query state renders through the traditional @octanejs/redux Provider; effects and browser listeners remain client-only. Dedicated SSR and hydration tests are included. | 2026-07-13 |
| [`@octanejs/remix-router`](#octanejsremix-router) | `react-router@8.2.0` | COMPLETE port (all phases shipped — full export parity, EXPECTED_MISSING is empty): the framework-agnostic router core (lib/router/* + framework-free helpers, ~12k lines) is vendored byte-close and validated by 161 ported upstream router tests plus four focused v8.2 regression pins; the data-mode React layer (createMemoryRouter, RouterProvider incl. the /dom flushSync variant, Outlet, Await, RenderErrorBoundary/errorElement, Link + useLinkClickHandler, and the full read-hook family) and the declarative layer (MemoryRouter, Routes/Route in BOTH children forms — descriptor children walked upstream-style, .tsrx block children via a registration collector — Navigate, createRoutesFromChildren/Elements, the UNSAFE_With*Props wrappers) and the DOM layer (createBrowserRouter/createHashRouter with __staticRouterHydrationData parsing, BrowserRouter/HashRouter/unstable_HistoryRouter, Link + NavLink incl. the isActive/isPending render props, useLinkClickHandler, useSearchParams) and the mutation layer (Form on octane's native delegated submit event, useSubmit incl. JSON encTypes, useFormAction with ?index resolution, useFetcher/useFetchers incl. fetcher.Form/load/submit/reset and shared keys), the guard/scroll layer (useBlocker, unstable_usePrompt, ScrollRestoration/UNSAFE_useScrollRestoration, useBeforeUnload, useViewTransitionState, unstable_useRoute/unstable_useRouterState), static SSR (StaticRouter, StaticRouterProvider, createStaticHandler/createStaticRouter rendering through octane/server — markup byte-identical to react-dom/server after marker stripping, hydration payload identical), and the vendored cookie/session server runtime (createCookie/createSession/createCookieSessionStorage/createMemorySessionStorage) are transcribed onto octane and differential-verified against real react-router. Framework-mode + RSC names (Meta/Links/Scripts, createRequestHandler, UNSAFE_ internals) exist as THROWING STUBS so parity is honest. | Refs are props (octane has no forwardRef) — Link's forwardRef becomes a `ref` prop; Error-boundary reset on location change / revalidation-idle happens in a layout effect one commit after upstream's render-phase derivation — same observable outcome; octane's flushSync inside an ambient flush degrades to a plain call drained at that flush's boundary (sync scroll/navigation notifies from within event handlers land at the flush boundary instead of nested) — consumer-invisible, conformance-pinned; Form's onSubmit is a NATIVE delegated submit listener (octane has no synthetic events): `event.submitter` is read directly off the SubmitEvent where React reads `event.nativeEvent.submitter` — same value, differential-verified; Block-children `<Routes>` collects `<Route>`s by registration (mount order) instead of upstream's element-children walk (source order) — a conditionally-mounted `<Route>` between static siblings registers after them, which only affects matchRoutes score TIES; conformance-pinned | Shipped: StaticRouter/StaticRouterProvider/createStaticHandler/createStaticRouter render through octane/server (remix-router-ssr vitest project compiles the whole graph in server mode; markup matches react-dom/server byte-for-byte after framework-marker stripping). Block-children <Routes> is CLIENT-only (the registration collector runs in layout effects) — use descriptor children or route objects for SSR. | 2026-07-13 |
| [`@octanejs/sonner`](#octanejssonner) | `sonner@2.0.7` | Complete against the published `sonner@2.0.7` public surface: `Toaster`, the callable `toast` API and all methods, `useSonner`, promise lifecycle, multiple toaster targeting, stacked layout, themes, styling, focus management, timers, and swipe dismissal. | Action callbacks receive native DOM `MouseEvent`s rather than React synthetic events; `Toaster` accepts its ref as a normal prop instead of using `forwardRef`; The document-visibility hook is guarded during SSR; upstream 2.0.7 reads `document.hidden` during render | Supported and tested: `Toaster` server-renders without browser globals, hydrates by adopting the server host, and can show the first client-created toast without replacing it. | 2026-07-13 |
| [`@octanejs/stylex`](#octanejsstylex) | `@stylexjs/stylex@0.19.0` | Full compile-time integration: re-exports the StyleX runtime API (`create`, `props`, `attrs`, `keyframes`, `defineVars`, `createTheme`) and registers as an import source; the `/vite` plugin runs the StyleX compiler over octane's compiled output and emits one static atomic stylesheet (`virtual:stylex.css`) with zero StyleX runtime in the bundle. | The `sx` JSX prop is not supported — spread `{...stylex.props(...)}` instead; The compiler runs over octane's compiled output rather than source, so StyleX's own PostCSS source-scanning setup is unused | Works under SSR — the stylesheet is static and server markup carries the final class names; no dedicated SSR test files. | 2026-07-09 |
| [`@octanejs/tanstack-ai`](#octanejstanstack-ai) | `@tanstack/ai-react@0.17.0` | Ports the @tanstack/ai-react 0.17.0 hook surface (useChat, useRealtimeChat, useGeneration, useGenerateImage/Audio/Speech/Video, useTranscription, useSummarize, useAudioRecorder, useMcpAppBridge) while reusing @tanstack/ai 0.41.0 and @tanstack/ai-client 0.21.0 unchanged and mirroring all 30 @tanstack/ai-client convenience re-exports from the upstream index. | The `./mcp-apps` subpath and its `MCPAppResource` component are not ported: they render `AppRenderer` from the React-only `@mcp-ui/client`, which has no Octane equivalent. The framework-agnostic `useMcpAppBridge` hook is ported and available on the main entry; Octane uses native events: text/file/recorder inputs drive updates via `onInput`; there is no synthetic `onChange` layer; Octane has no StrictMode double-invoke and always provides `useId`, so no random-id fallback is needed; The TanStack AI Devtools bridge is tagged `framework: 'octane'` (upstream `@tanstack/ai-react` sends `'react'`), so the devtools identify this binding correctly; Realtime reconnects and token refreshes use the latest `getToken` and adapter supplied to the hook; upstream @tanstack/ai-react 0.17.0 captures the first render's callbacks; The declared realtime `onStatusChange` callback is invoked alongside the hook's state update; upstream @tanstack/ai-react 0.17.0 currently drops the external callback; Changing `useChat`'s connection or fetcher updates the active ChatClient in place and preserves conversation state; upstream @tanstack/ai-react 0.17.0 captures the initial transport; One upstream `useChat` test case ("auto-resume on mount / when the browser comes back online") is omitted: it targets `ChatClient.prototype.maybeAutoResume`, an API absent from the pinned (and latest published) `@tanstack/ai-client@0.21.0` and never invoked by `useChat`. It is untestable in this binding until that dependency ships the method | Supported and tested: useChat renders its initial message snapshot through octane/server without a DOM. | 2026-07-16 |
| [`@octanejs/tanstack-devtools`](#octanejstanstack-devtools) | `@tanstack/react-devtools@0.10.7` | Ports the @tanstack/react-devtools 0.10.7 public surface (the `TanStackDevtools` component plus its plugin/init types) onto Octane while reusing the framework-agnostic `@tanstack/devtools` 0.12.5 core (`TanStackDevtoolsCore`) unchanged. Plugin, title, and custom-trigger content authored as Octane elements is portaled into the containers the core creates. | Public adapter types use Octane-prefixed names: `TanStackDevtoolsOctanePlugin` and `TanStackDevtoolsOctaneInit` (upstream: `TanStackDevtoolsReactPlugin` / `TanStackDevtoolsReactInit`); `ref` is the normal React-19-style ref prop and events are native (no synthetic layer), consistent with the rest of the Octane bindings; The main entry also re-exports the framework-agnostic `@tanstack/devtools` core surface (`TanStackDevtoolsCore`, container-id constants, and plugin authoring types) so consumers do not need a direct dependency on `@tanstack/devtools` for typing plugins; Plugin/title/trigger content is rendered through a tiny `DevtoolsPortal` component (a createPortal VALUE), because Octane renders a returned portal at any position rather than only as a direct JSX child | Supported and tested: the component renders its absolutely-positioned anchor element through octane/server without a DOM; the core is constructed but never mounted server-side (mount is a client-only effect). | 2026-07-17 |
| [`@octanejs/tanstack-form`](#octanejstanstack-form) | `@tanstack/react-form@1.33.2` | Ports the complete @tanstack/react-form 1.33.2 adapter surface (`useForm`, `useField`, form and field groups, hook contexts and component composition) while re-exporting @tanstack/form-core 1.33.2 unchanged and using @octanejs/tanstack-store for subscriptions. | Octane uses native events: text controls call `field.handleChange` from `onInput`; TanStack Form's `onChange` validator and listener option names remain unchanged; Octane has no StrictMode double-invoke and always provides `useId`, so the adapter omits StrictMode scenarios and the legacy random-UUID fallback; Component registration accepts Octane function components; class components are not supported by Octane | Supported and tested: fields and form subscriptions render their initial snapshots through octane/server without a DOM. | 2026-07-15 |
| [`@octanejs/tanstack-query`](#octanejstanstack-query) | `@tanstack/react-query@5.101.0` | Complete: 58/58 runtime exports plus the full TypeScript surface; the export surface is byte-identical to upstream in both directions (locked by test), and `@tanstack/query-core` is re-exported verbatim. | Suspense integrates via octane's `use(thenable)` rather than throwing a promise (observable behavior matches) | `HydrationBoundary` fully ported (incl. streaming `promise`/`dehydratedAt` re-hydration); the SSR/streaming server entries and server-render tests are still open. | 2026-07-06 |
| [`@octanejs/tanstack-router`](#octanejstanstack-router) | `@tanstack/react-router@1.170.16` | Code-based routing at full binding parity (2026-07-06 gap-closure sweep): the full Match pipeline, router lifecycle events, the complete read-hook family, full-parity `Link` (preloading, masking, `activeProps`), `useBlocker`/`Block`, `Await`/`defer`, scroll restoration, lazy routes, not-found handling, and search-param validation/middleware — differential-verified byte-equal vs the real `@tanstack/react-router`. | Refs are props — `createLink`'s `forwardRef` becomes a `ref` prop; No `flushSync` in the `Link` click handler; navigation state updates run synchronously | SSR entries (`RouterServer`/`RouterClient`, `HeadContent`/`Scripts`) not yet ported; no SSR tests. | 2026-07-06 |
| [`@octanejs/tanstack-store`](#octanejstanstack-store) | `@tanstack/react-store@0.11.0` | Re-exports `@tanstack/store@0.11.0` unchanged and implements the stable React binding surface (`useSelector`, `useAtom`, `useCreateAtom`, `useCreateStore`, `createStoreContext`, and deprecated `useStore`) on Octane hooks. | The upstream experimental `_useStore` hook is intentionally omitted; use `useSelector` with `store.actions` or `store.setState` instead | Supported: selectors, writable atoms, and store context read their current snapshots during server rendering; the adapter has no browser-only initialization. | 2026-07-15 |
| [`@octanejs/tanstack-table`](#octanejstanstack-table) | `@tanstack/react-table@8.21.3` | Complete 1:1 port: the framework-agnostic `@tanstack/table-core` (createTable + all feature row models) is reused verbatim; the ~100-line React adapter (`useReactTable`, `flexRender`) is transcribed onto octane hooks, preserving upstream's useState-based state wiring. | `flexRender`'s class-component and `react.memo`/`forwardRef` exotic-component branches are dropped — octane has no class components or forwardRef, and octane's `memo()` returns a plain function, so `typeof === 'function'` covers every component | No SSR-specific surface; table-core is pure computation. | 2026-07-11 |
| [`@octanejs/tanstack-virtual`](#octanejstanstack-virtual) | `@tanstack/react-virtual@3.14.5` | Complete 1:1 port: the framework-agnostic `@tanstack/virtual-core` (Virtualizer + observers + windowing math) is reused verbatim; the React adapter (`useVirtualizer`, `useWindowVirtualizer`, incl. `useFlushSync` and the experimental `directDomUpdates` surface) is transcribed onto octane hooks, preserving upstream's force-update + flushSync-on-sync-scroll wiring and layout-effect lifecycle. | octane's `flushSync` called while a flush is already on the stack degrades to a plain call drained by the ambient flush (re-entrancy guard) — sync scroll notifies dispatched from inside a discrete-event flush land at that flush's boundary instead of nested; consumer-invisible, pinned by a conformance test | SSR-safe: `useIsomorphicLayoutEffect` degrades to `useEffect` without `document`; the first paint windows from `initialRect`/`initialOffset` exactly as upstream. No dedicated SSR tests. | 2026-07-12 |
| [`@octanejs/testing-library`](#octanejstesting-library) | `@testing-library/react` (unpinned) | `render`/`rerender`/`cleanup`/`renderHook` + `act` over the verbatim `@testing-library/dom` (every query, `screen`, `within`, `waitFor`, `fireEvent`, `prettyDOM`, `configure`), with commit timing wired to octane's scheduler via the dom-library's `eventWrapper`/`asyncWrapper` config. | `fireEvent` dispatches real native events — no React remappings (`fireEvent.change` fires a native `change`, not `input`) and no enter/leave/focus double-dispatch; Not ported: the `ReactStrictMode` wrapper, `legacyRoot`, and the `onCaughtError`/`onRecoverableError` options | `hydrate: true` adopts octane SSR output via `hydrateRoot`. | 2026-07-09 |
| [`@octanejs/three`](#octanejsthree) | `@react-three/fiber@9.6.1 (2a528745)` | Technical-preview Milestones 0–10 surface: renderer configuration and the DOM Canvas boundary, compiler ABI and renderer-local Three intrinsic types, catalogue and both extend forms, primitive/args construction, Three prop application, attachment, ordered placement/recreation, retained visibility, lifecycle/ref delivery, ownership-aware disposal, promise-returning HTMLCanvasElement and OffscreenCanvas roots, Octane act/flushSync scheduling, callback-aware unmountComponentAtNode, callable root state, scene/camera/raycaster and resize/DPR/viewport configuration, shadows/colors, one shared frame loop, controlled WebXR loop handoff, context-restore invalidation, compatible/reconstructing HMR, global effects, useStore/useThree/useFrame/useGraph and managed-instance helpers, the ray/pointer event system with DOM sources and custom managers, a keyed useLoader cache with preload/clear and GLTF graph augmentation, retained Suspense/Activity behavior, client Three-to-DOM pending/error projection, same-renderer createPortal targets with state/event enclaves and physical Three event bubbling, client-only Canvas shell streaming and production Vite/Rsbuild hydration adoption with the matching raw Rspack graph split, the explicit-target low-level DOMRegion boundary, a deterministic testing harness, an asynchronously acknowledged structured-clone transport proof, a checked public API/subpath matrix, Three r156/current compatibility lanes, a packed external consumer, real WebGL failure/recovery coverage, and semantic-checksummed renderer and shipped-size benchmarks. | Octane owns component execution, hooks, context, scheduling, Suspense, refs, and effects instead of embedding React Reconciler; The programmatic root renders an Octane component plus props rather than a React element descriptor; The upstream callable store selector remains order-based because dynamic function calls cannot receive compiler slots; compiler-visible useStore(selector) and useThree(selector) preserve Octane's conditional-hook semantics; buildGraph omits unnamed mesh and material entries, plus array-valued material entries, instead of publishing empty or undefined keys; Removing a pierced prop resets its original nested target; R3F 9.6.1 mistakenly writes that default to the leaf key on the root object; Reconstructing a captured or hovered object rewrites nested stored intersections to the replacement; R3F 9.6.1 updates only the outer hover identity and capture-map key, which leaves captured delivery pointing at the retired object; Hidden retained Activity subtrees are excluded from recursive raycasts; Three r172 ignores Object3D.visible during raycasting, so R3F 9.6.1 can otherwise pierce a hidden descendant through an interactive visible ancestor; Managed and externally leased portal targets are root-scoped and cross-root portal placement is rejected before mutation; this makes the universal target-handle lifetime explicit; Root teardown and unmountComponentAtNode callback delivery are synchronous; R3F 9.6.1 defers its registry teardown and callback by 500 milliseconds; DOMRegion is an Octane-specific explicit-target Three-to-DOM primitive, not R3F or Drei Html and not the WebXR DOM Overlay API; it intentionally defines no positioning, occlusion, styling, or layout contract | Three scene modules are client-only and Canvas.children is omitted from the server graph. Canvas streams its DOM shell and native fallback, then production Vite and Rsbuild hydration adopt those nodes and create one Three root on the client; raw Rspack proves the equivalent client/server graph split without claiming an application SSR lifecycle. DOMRegion and its reverse-DOM content remain inside the omitted client-only Three scene. | 2026-07-17 |
| [`@octanejs/tiptap`](#octanejstiptap) | `@tiptap/react@3.28.0` | Complete @tiptap/react 3.28.0 adapter surface across the root and ./menus entries: @tiptap/core re-exports, editor hooks and contexts, the EditorContent portal bridge, compound Tiptap API, ReactRenderer, custom NodeView/MarkView renderers and helpers, BubbleMenu, and FloatingMenu. | Subscriptions use Octane's native useSyncExternalStore implementation, so the published binding does not depend on React or use-sync-external-store; EditorConsumer is a render-prop compatibility component because Octane contexts do not expose React's .Consumer property; Renderer components are Octane component bodies and refs are ordinary props; the React-prefixed public names are retained for TipTap source compatibility without a React dependency; NodeViewWrapper consumes its as prop after selecting the host tag; @tiptap/react 3.28.0 also forwards that prop as an invalid DOM attribute; BubbleMenu and FloatingMenu handlers receive native browser events rather than React synthetic events; ReactMarkView tears down its portal when ProseMirror destroys the mark view, closing a renderer leak present in @tiptap/react 3.28.0 | Covered across the complete surface: hooks use null server snapshots and suppress editor construction without a DOM, static NodeView/MarkView helpers render without a DOM renderer, detached menu targets are client-only, and hydration adopts deferred server shells before mounting live custom views and menus. | 2026-07-17 |
| [`@octanejs/visx`](#octanejsvisx) | `@visx/visx@4.0.0 + master@485c035` | Complete current Visx 4.x web runtime surface: the exact 35-namespace aggregate, all 40 feature entry points, and the eight public a11y/react, a11y/server, axis/react, scale/react, shape/react, theme/react, tooltip/floating, and voronoi/react subpaths. Released-only packages chord, delaunay, react-spring, sankey, and stats remain directly importable exactly as upstream specifies. | Interaction callbacks receive native DOM events through Octane's delegated event system instead of React synthetic events; All React class controllers and class-instance refs are replaced by native functional TSRX hooks; Brush intentionally omits upstream's legacy innerRef instance handle; Deterministic text metrics and annotation bounds, pure SplitLinePath SVG sampling, and collision-aware estimated wordcloud rectangles replace browser-only measurement/canvas paths so fixed-size output is identical during SSR and first hydration. Font-specific wrapping, browser-specific path length rounding, and pixel-exact d3-cloud packing can differ; The react-spring entry point uses a deterministic requestAnimationFrame numeric interpolator rather than spring-physics timing, and Zoom uses native wheel/pointer/touch listeners rather than @use-gesture/react at runtime. Their public Visx props and exports are retained; Zoom imports framework-neutral @use-gesture/core types only | Fixed-dimension primitives, wrapped XYChart series, annotations, text, and wordclouds emit complete deterministic SVG on the server. Real hydrateRoot adoption preserves the same SVG/definition/axis/text/series/annotation/wordcloud nodes without warnings, replacement, or post-effect markup changes; generated IDs, measurement fallbacks, portals, and responsive initial sizes are covered. | 2026-07-14 |
| [`@octanejs/zustand`](#octanejszustand) | `zustand@5.0.14` | Complete 1:1 port: the framework-agnostic vanilla store is reused verbatim; `create`/`useStore`, `shallow`/`useShallow`, the traditional equality-fn variants, and all middleware (persist, devtools, subscribeWithSelector, combine, redux). | Unstable selectors (a new reference every render) settle after a bounded number of re-renders instead of hitting React's `useSyncExternalStore` warning loop — still prefer `useShallow` | No SSR-specific surface; no dedicated SSR tests. | 2026-07-06 |

## @octanejs/apollo-client

[`packages/apollo-client`](../packages/apollo-client) `0.1.4` — ports `@apollo/client@4.2.6`. Status data: [`packages/apollo-client/status.json`](../packages/apollo-client/status.json).

Complete published client adapter surface: all 18 @apollo/client/react runtime exports and their Apollo 4.2.6 TypeScript declarations, plus the framework-neutral root/testing exports and an Octane MockedProvider.

Known divergences:

- Suspense unwraps stable Apollo promises through Octane use() instead of React's use() or a thrown-promise fallback.
- The React class-based MockedProvider is an equivalent Octane function component.
- React Server Components and Apollo's React Compiler-generated entry are intentionally not exposed.

SSR / hydration: Core hooks use Octane's server hook implementations, but Apollo's multi-pass non-Suspense query prepass, cache extraction/restore integration, and dedicated SSR/hydration tests remain open.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-14.

## @octanejs/aria

[`packages/aria`](../packages/aria) `0.0.3` — ports `react-aria@3.50.0`. Status data: [`packages/aria/status.json`](../packages/aria/status.json).

Phases 0-1 complete: the utils foundation, SSR utilities, the complete interactions area (usePress, useHover, focus/keyboard family, useLongPress, useMove, Pressable/PressResponder), the focus area (FocusScope with containment/restore/focus managers, FocusRing, useFocusRing, useHasTabbableChild), the i18n area (I18nProvider, locale/collator/formatter/filter hooks), form validation (useFormValidation + stately useFormValidationState), and the leaf hooks: useButton/useToggleButton(+Group), useLabel/useField, useCheckbox(+Group/+Item), useRadio/useRadioGroup, useSwitch, useTextField, useSearchField, useProgressBar, useMeter, useSeparator, useLink, useDisclosure, useToolbar, VisuallyHidden — plus the matching react-stately state hooks under `@octanejs/aria/stately`. Differential-verified byte-identical against the real react-aria (interactions + button/toggle/checkbox/switch/radio/textfield/progress fixtures). Collections, overlays, and react-aria-components are not started — see the migration plan.

Known divergences:

- Text-input DOM wiring uses octane's native `onInput` (per keystroke) instead of React's synthetic `onChange`; React Aria's public value-level `onChange(value)` callbacks are unchanged.
- `forwardRef` becomes octane's ref-as-prop.
- i18n server serializer: hoisted-string variable names stay valid identifiers past 26 entries (upstream's `common.size + 97` yields `{`, `|`, … — a SyntaxError in the emitted inline script).
- useDefaultLocale, SSR branch: `direction` derives from the server-injected locale via `isRTL` (upstream hardcodes 'ltr' even for an injected RTL locale, disagreeing with its own getDefaultLocale).

SSR / hydration: Not yet covered (planned for Phase 8; see the migration plan).

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-17.

## @octanejs/base-ui

[`packages/base-ui`](../packages/base-ui) `0.1.7` — ports `@base-ui/react@1.6.0`. Status data: [`packages/base-ui/status.json`](../packages/base-ui/status.json).

Alpha, in progress: the foundation + overlay infrastructure and the first component set (Dialog, AlertDialog, Popover open-path) landed, ported at full fidelity and differential-verified against the real `@base-ui/react`.

Known divergences:

- Handlers receive native DOM events (no synthetic layer).
- `forwardRef` becomes ref-as-prop; `className` composes via octane's `normalizeClass` (the render-prop string merge matches Base UI exactly).

SSR / hydration: No dedicated SSR/hydration tests yet.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-08.

See also: [`docs/base-ui-migration-plan.md`](base-ui-migration-plan.md)

## @octanejs/dexie

[`packages/dexie`](../packages/dexie) `0.1.2` — ports `dexie-react-hooks@4.4.0`. Status data: [`packages/dexie/status.json`](../packages/dexie/status.json).

Port of the public dexie-react-hooks surface: useObservable, useLiveQuery, useSuspendingObservable, useSuspendingLiveQuery, usePermissions, and useDocument, with Dexie's framework-neutral API re-exported from the package root.

Known divergences:

- Suspending hooks integrate with Octane's use() rather than React's use() or thrown-promise implementation details.
- Hook call-site slots are forwarded through Octane's compiler binding ABI.
- useDocument requires consumers to install and import y-dexie and yjs before using the hook; those integrations remain optional.

SSR / hydration: Supported for non-suspending live queries: SSR returns the configured default without opening IndexedDB, and hydration adopts the server host before replacing the default with live data. Suspending live queries remain client-oriented and do not claim server data loading.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-16.

## @octanejs/dnd-kit

[`packages/dnd-kit`](../packages/dnd-kit) `0.1.4` — ports `@dnd-kit/react@0.5.0`. Status data: [`packages/dnd-kit/status.json`](../packages/dnd-kit/status.json).

Complete modern dnd-kit React-adapter surface: DragDropProvider, DragOverlay, useDraggable/useDroppable, manager/monitor/operation hooks, PointerSensor/KeyboardSensor re-exports, the public signal-hook utilities, useSortable, and all four upstream entry points.

Known divergences:

- DragOverlay distinguishes octane compiled children blocks from function render props; ordinary typed usage is behaviorally equivalent.
- useSortable retains the upstream keyboard plugin by default but omits OptimisticSortingPlugin because moving one host element before application state commits can split an Octane keyed DOM range; explicit plugin arrays remain authoritative.

SSR / hydration: Static SSR and hydration are covered; DOM plugins initialize only after client refs register.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-15.

- Targets the modern @dnd-kit/react API. The legacy @dnd-kit/core 6.x API is intentionally out of scope.

## @octanejs/floating-ui

[`packages/floating-ui`](../packages/floating-ui) `0.1.8` — ports `@floating-ui/react@0.27.19`. Status data: [`packages/floating-ui/status.json`](../packages/floating-ui/status.json).

Positioning (`useFloating`, ref-aware `arrow`, the `@floating-ui/dom` middleware re-exports, the floating tree), the full interaction-hook set (`useInteractions`, `useHover` + `safePolygon`, `useClick`, `useFocus`, `useDismiss`, `useRole`, `useClientPoint`, `useListNavigation`, `useTypeahead`), the component layer (`FloatingPortal`, `FloatingOverlay`, `FloatingFocusManager`, `FloatingArrow`, `FloatingList`, `Composite`), and transitions + `FloatingDelayGroup`.

Known divergences:

- `forwardRef` becomes octane's ref-as-prop.

SSR / hydration: No dedicated SSR/hydration tests.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-05.

- Not yet ported: the `inner`/`useInnerOffset` middleware pair.

## @octanejs/hook-form

[`packages/hook-form`](../packages/hook-form) `0.1.6` — ports `react-hook-form@7.81.0`. Status data: [`packages/hook-form/status.json`](../packages/hook-form/status.json).

Complete port of react-hook-form 7.81.0 (upstream commit b7df98c2) with the upstream test suite ported: `useForm`, `useController`, `useFieldArray`, `useFormState`, `useWatch`, `useFormContext`/`FormProvider`, schema resolvers, and all validation modes.

Known divergences:

- `register()` returns `onInput` (octane's native per-keystroke event) instead of React's synthetic `onChange`; mode names and `register` option keys keep the upstream spelling.
- Ported tests directly assert Octane's documented microtask-flush commit granularity, eager `Object.is` setState bailout, and native input-event delivery; the suite contains no skipped or expected-failure cases.

SSR / hydration: Supported and tested — the upstream `*.server.test.tsx` suite runs via `octane/server` with byte-identical markup.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-14.

## @octanejs/i18next

[`packages/i18next`](../packages/i18next) `0.1.4` — ports `react-i18next@17.0.9`. Status data: [`packages/i18next/status.json`](../packages/i18next/status.json).

Complete runtime port of react-i18next 17.0.9: useTranslation, I18nextProvider/context, Trans/TransWithoutContext, IcuTrans/IcuTransWithoutContext, Translation, the withTranslation/withSSR HOCs, useSSR, namespace reporting, initialization/default helpers, and the root ICU helper exports over the unchanged i18next core.

Known divergences:

- Trans children that must be inspected are passed in prop position (`children={<>…</>}`) or through `defaults` + `components`; natural .tsrx block children are opaque compiled render bodies and fall back with a development warning.
- Suspense uses octane's `use(thenable)` instead of throwing a Promise.
- withTranslation's `withRef` option uses octane's ref-as-prop model; class components are unsupported.
- The React/Babel-specific `icu.macro` subpath is not shipped; the runtime IcuTrans APIs are fully supported.

SSR / hydration: Preloaded renderToString output and namespace collection are covered; useSSR, withSSR, getInitialProps, and composeInitialProps are ported. A dedicated hydration differential is still open.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-13.

## @octanejs/jotai

[`packages/jotai`](../packages/jotai) `0.1.6` — ports `jotai@2.20.1`. Status data: [`packages/jotai/status.json`](../packages/jotai/status.json).

Complete 1:1 port: the framework-agnostic vanilla core (`jotai/vanilla`, `/vanilla/utils`, `/vanilla/internals`) is reused verbatim; the React layer (`Provider`, `useStore`, `useAtom`, `useAtomValue`, `useSetAtom`) and `react/utils` (`useResetAtom`, `useReducerAtom`, `useAtomCallback`, `useHydrateAtoms`) are ported onto octane hooks, preserving upstream's useReducer force-update + effect-subscription implementation, async atoms via octane's `use()`.

Known divergences:

- `jotai/babel/*` (React-specific compile-time plugins) is not shipped.

SSR / hydration: No SSR-specific surface; `useHydrateAtoms` is ported and usable for hydration seeding; no dedicated SSR tests.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-11.

## @octanejs/lexical

[`packages/lexical`](../packages/lexical) `0.1.8` — ports `@lexical/react@0.46.0`. Status data: [`packages/lexical/status.json`](../packages/lexical/status.json).

35 of 39 `@lexical/react` modules ported: composer + contexts, the editable surface, plain/rich text, and the full plugin/menu set (history, lists + check-list, links, tables, markdown shortcuts, the typeahead/node-menu/context-menu family, draggable-block, character-limit, …) plus the `useLexical*` hooks.

Known divergences:

- Positioning uses `@floating-ui/dom` instead of `@floating-ui/react`.
- The class-based `LexicalErrorBoundary` becomes an octane error boundary; `forwardRef` becomes ref-as-prop.

SSR / hydration: No dedicated SSR/hydration tests.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-09.

- Not ported (4 modules, with reasons): `LexicalCollaborationPlugin` (real-time Yjs collaboration needs a two-peer harness), `LexicalExtensionComposer`/`LexicalExtensionEditorComposer` (the newer extension API wraps a React-only subsystem), and `LexicalTreeView` (wraps the `@lexical/devtools-core` React component).

## @octanejs/lucide

[`packages/lucide`](../packages/lucide) `0.1.4` — ports `lucide-react@1.24.0`. Status data: [`packages/lucide/status.json`](../packages/lucide/status.json).

Complete against the published `lucide-react@1.24.0` runtime surface: every canonical icon and alias, the `icons` namespace, `Icon`, `createLucideIcon`, `LucideProvider`, `useLucideContext`, `DynamicIcon`, `iconNames`, `dynamicIconImports`, and per-icon subpath imports.

Known divergences:

- Icon refs are normal Octane `ref` props rather than React `forwardRef` components.
- Event callbacks receive native DOM events rather than React synthetic events.

SSR / hydration: Supported and tested: icons and provider defaults render through `octane/server`, and client hydration adopts the server-rendered SVG element.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-13.

- Generated wrappers consume official framework-neutral `@lucide/icons@1.24.0` data, so SVG geometry is not copied or maintained by the port.
- Generation checks pin the React export, alias, and dynamic-name surfaces and reject stale generated files.

See also: [`docs/lucide-port-plan.md`](lucide-port-plan.md)

## @octanejs/mdx

[`packages/mdx`](../packages/mdx) `0.1.6` — ports `@mdx-js/mdx@3.1.1`. Status data: [`packages/mdx/status.json`](../packages/mdx/status.json).

The full compile-don't-interpret pipeline: `.mdx`/`.md` → `@mdx-js/mdx` (reused verbatim) → octane compiler, via the `octaneMdx()` Vite plugin plus the `./compile` and `./server` entries; `@mdx-js/react`'s provider layer (`MDXProvider`/`useMDXComponents`) is ported onto octane context. The octane website runs on it.

Known divergences:

- `useMDXComponents` drops upstream's `useMemo` referential-stability wrapper so the call is valid in both server and client runtimes (same observable mapping).

SSR / hydration: Full SSR + hydration coverage — server-compiled documents render via `renderToString` and hydrate byte-for-byte (`ssr.test.ts`, `hydration.test.ts`).

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-07.

See also: [`docs/mdx-migration-plan.md`](mdx-migration-plan.md)

## @octanejs/motion

[`packages/motion`](../packages/motion) `0.1.8` — ports `motion@12.40.0`. Status data: [`packages/motion/status.json`](../packages/motion/status.json).

Core surface: `motion.<tag>` (animate, gestures, variants with propagation/stagger, drag, layout basics), `AnimatePresence`, `MotionConfig`, and the motion-value hooks (`useMotionValue`, `useScroll`, `useTransform`, `useSpring`, `useAnimate`, `useMotionValueEvent`); motion-dom's animation engine and gesture primitives are reused verbatim.

Known divergences:

- Exit animations run via cleanup-before-detach instead of React's deferred-deletion machinery.
- `layout`/`layoutId` use single-element FLIP, not the full projection tree.

SSR / hydration: No SSR-specific surface; no dedicated SSR tests.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-06.

- Not yet ported: nested/shared layout projection (incl. child scale correction and shared layout during drag), drag momentum + elastic physics, reduced-motion enforcement, the `useTransform` output-map form, and `when: 'beforeChildren' | 'afterChildren'` sequencing.

## @octanejs/radix

[`packages/radix`](../packages/radix) `0.1.8` — ports `radix-ui@1.6.1`. Status data: [`packages/radix/status.json`](../packages/radix/status.json).

Complete against the unified `radix-ui@1.6.1` component surface — all primitives (incl. Dialog, the Menu/DropdownMenu/ContextMenu family, Popover, Tooltip, Select, NavigationMenu, Toast, Menubar, Slider, the form controls, and OneTimePasswordField/PasswordToggleField) plus the composition/state/overlay foundations — verified by a differential suite (same fixtures through octane and the real radix-ui, byte-identical DOM).

Known divergences:

- `Slot`/`asChild` compose element descriptors (prop-position JSX, `createElement`, `.map()` returns), not children-position JSX.
- `forwardRef` becomes octane's ref-as-prop.

SSR / hydration: SSR/hydration coverage for the overlay/portal components is still open (tracked in the migration plan).

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-08.

See also: [`docs/radix-migration-plan.md`](radix-migration-plan.md)

## @octanejs/recharts

[`packages/recharts`](../packages/recharts) `0.1.6` — ports `recharts@3.9.2`. Status data: [`packages/recharts/status.json`](../packages/recharts/status.json).

Partial (phases 0–1 of 5): the static `BarChart`/`LineChart` pipeline end-to-end (`isAnimationActive={false}`), byte-identical to upstream in the differential rig; the Redux/RTK state layer, `Surface`/`Layer`, and the pure shape set are in place.

Known divergences:

- Chart events coordinate through octane's native delegated events rather than React's synthetic layer.

SSR / hydration: Untested; text measurement (`getStringSize`) returns 0×0 under SSR.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-07.

- Planned next (phases 2–5): `Tooltip`/`Legend`/`ResponsiveContainer`, the remaining cartesian charts, polar charts, and animation + chart sync. Target surface: 97 runtime + 78 type exports.

See also: [`docs/recharts-port-plan.md`](recharts-port-plan.md)

## @octanejs/redux

[`packages/redux`](../packages/redux) `0.1.6` — ports `react-redux@9.3.0`. Status data: [`packages/redux/status.json`](../packages/redux/status.json).

The hooks + `Provider` surface of react-redux 9.3.0 (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`, `useStore`, and the custom-context factory variants) on octane's `useSyncExternalStore`; works with any Redux 5 / Redux Toolkit store. Export parity is pinned by test.

Known divergences:

- `connect()` (the legacy HOC surface) intentionally throws — the hooks API is the supported surface.
- Error messages are octane-branded.

SSR / hydration: No SSR-specific surface; no dedicated SSR tests.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-08.

## @octanejs/redux-toolkit

[`packages/redux-toolkit`](../packages/redux-toolkit) `0.1.4` — ports `@reduxjs/toolkit@2.12.0`. Status data: [`packages/redux-toolkit/status.json`](../packages/redux-toolkit/status.json).

Complete four-entry-point port: the framework-agnostic Toolkit and RTK Query core are re-exported verbatim; `/query/react` provides generated query, lazy-query, mutation, infinite-query, prefetch hooks and `ApiProvider`; `/react` provides the dynamic-middleware dispatch-hook integration.

Known divergences:

- The compatibility `/react` subpaths and `reactHooksModule` names are retained, but use octane and `@octanejs/redux` internally.
- `useDebugValue` is octane's no-op compatibility hook; observable query behavior is unchanged.

SSR / hydration: Preloaded RTK Query state renders through the traditional @octanejs/redux Provider; effects and browser listeners remain client-only. Dedicated SSR and hydration tests are included.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-13.

## @octanejs/remix-router

[`packages/remix-router`](../packages/remix-router) `0.1.5` — ports `react-router@8.2.0`. Status data: [`packages/remix-router/status.json`](../packages/remix-router/status.json).

COMPLETE port (all phases shipped — full export parity, EXPECTED_MISSING is empty): the framework-agnostic router core (lib/router/* + framework-free helpers, ~12k lines) is vendored byte-close and validated by 161 ported upstream router tests plus four focused v8.2 regression pins; the data-mode React layer (createMemoryRouter, RouterProvider incl. the /dom flushSync variant, Outlet, Await, RenderErrorBoundary/errorElement, Link + useLinkClickHandler, and the full read-hook family) and the declarative layer (MemoryRouter, Routes/Route in BOTH children forms — descriptor children walked upstream-style, .tsrx block children via a registration collector — Navigate, createRoutesFromChildren/Elements, the UNSAFE_With*Props wrappers) and the DOM layer (createBrowserRouter/createHashRouter with __staticRouterHydrationData parsing, BrowserRouter/HashRouter/unstable_HistoryRouter, Link + NavLink incl. the isActive/isPending render props, useLinkClickHandler, useSearchParams) and the mutation layer (Form on octane's native delegated submit event, useSubmit incl. JSON encTypes, useFormAction with ?index resolution, useFetcher/useFetchers incl. fetcher.Form/load/submit/reset and shared keys), the guard/scroll layer (useBlocker, unstable_usePrompt, ScrollRestoration/UNSAFE_useScrollRestoration, useBeforeUnload, useViewTransitionState, unstable_useRoute/unstable_useRouterState), static SSR (StaticRouter, StaticRouterProvider, createStaticHandler/createStaticRouter rendering through octane/server — markup byte-identical to react-dom/server after marker stripping, hydration payload identical), and the vendored cookie/session server runtime (createCookie/createSession/createCookieSessionStorage/createMemorySessionStorage) are transcribed onto octane and differential-verified against real react-router. Framework-mode + RSC names (Meta/Links/Scripts, createRequestHandler, UNSAFE_ internals) exist as THROWING STUBS so parity is honest.

Known divergences:

- Refs are props (octane has no forwardRef) — Link's forwardRef becomes a `ref` prop.
- Error-boundary reset on location change / revalidation-idle happens in a layout effect one commit after upstream's render-phase derivation — same observable outcome.
- octane's flushSync inside an ambient flush degrades to a plain call drained at that flush's boundary (sync scroll/navigation notifies from within event handlers land at the flush boundary instead of nested) — consumer-invisible, conformance-pinned.
- Form's onSubmit is a NATIVE delegated submit listener (octane has no synthetic events): `event.submitter` is read directly off the SubmitEvent where React reads `event.nativeEvent.submitter` — same value, differential-verified.
- Block-children `<Routes>` collects `<Route>`s by registration (mount order) instead of upstream's element-children walk (source order) — a conditionally-mounted `<Route>` between static siblings registers after them, which only affects matchRoutes score TIES; conformance-pinned.

SSR / hydration: Shipped: StaticRouter/StaticRouterProvider/createStaticHandler/createStaticRouter render through octane/server (remix-router-ssr vitest project compiles the whole graph in server mode; markup matches react-dom/server byte-for-byte after framework-marker stripping). Block-children <Routes> is CLIENT-only (the registration collector runs in layout effects) — use descriptor children or route objects for SSR.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-13.

- Full export parity: tests/conformance/parity.test.ts pins EXPECTED_MISSING at []. Framework mode (needs @react-router/dev) and RSC are permanently out of scope — those names are throwing stubs with scope-policy messages. The cookie/session server runtime is vendored (adds the `cookie-es` dependency, as upstream). React Router 8 removes react-router-dom, makes middleware unconditional, and removes hasErrorBoundary plus the v8 future flags.

## @octanejs/sonner

[`packages/sonner`](../packages/sonner) `0.1.4` — ports `sonner@2.0.7`. Status data: [`packages/sonner/status.json`](../packages/sonner/status.json).

Complete against the published `sonner@2.0.7` public surface: `Toaster`, the callable `toast` API and all methods, `useSonner`, promise lifecycle, multiple toaster targeting, stacked layout, themes, styling, focus management, timers, and swipe dismissal.

Known divergences:

- Action callbacks receive native DOM `MouseEvent`s rather than React synthetic events.
- `Toaster` accepts its ref as a normal prop instead of using `forwardRef`.
- The document-visibility hook is guarded during SSR; upstream 2.0.7 reads `document.hidden` during render.

SSR / hydration: Supported and tested: `Toaster` server-renders without browser globals, hydrates by adopting the server host, and can show the first client-created toast without replacing it.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-13.

## @octanejs/stylex

[`packages/stylex`](../packages/stylex) `0.1.8` — ports `@stylexjs/stylex@0.19.0`. Status data: [`packages/stylex/status.json`](../packages/stylex/status.json).

Full compile-time integration: re-exports the StyleX runtime API (`create`, `props`, `attrs`, `keyframes`, `defineVars`, `createTheme`) and registers as an import source; the `/vite` plugin runs the StyleX compiler over octane's compiled output and emits one static atomic stylesheet (`virtual:stylex.css`) with zero StyleX runtime in the bundle.

Known divergences:

- The `sx` JSX prop is not supported — spread `{...stylex.props(...)}` instead.
- The compiler runs over octane's compiled output rather than source, so StyleX's own PostCSS source-scanning setup is unused.

SSR / hydration: Works under SSR — the stylesheet is static and server markup carries the final class names; no dedicated SSR test files.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-09.

## @octanejs/tanstack-ai

[`packages/tanstack-ai`](../packages/tanstack-ai) `0.0.3` — ports `@tanstack/ai-react@0.17.0`. Status data: [`packages/tanstack-ai/status.json`](../packages/tanstack-ai/status.json).

Ports the @tanstack/ai-react 0.17.0 hook surface (useChat, useRealtimeChat, useGeneration, useGenerateImage/Audio/Speech/Video, useTranscription, useSummarize, useAudioRecorder, useMcpAppBridge) while reusing @tanstack/ai 0.41.0 and @tanstack/ai-client 0.21.0 unchanged and mirroring all 30 @tanstack/ai-client convenience re-exports from the upstream index.

Known divergences:

- The `./mcp-apps` subpath and its `MCPAppResource` component are not ported: they render `AppRenderer` from the React-only `@mcp-ui/client`, which has no Octane equivalent. The framework-agnostic `useMcpAppBridge` hook is ported and available on the main entry.
- Octane uses native events: text/file/recorder inputs drive updates via `onInput`; there is no synthetic `onChange` layer.
- Octane has no StrictMode double-invoke and always provides `useId`, so no random-id fallback is needed.
- The TanStack AI Devtools bridge is tagged `framework: 'octane'` (upstream `@tanstack/ai-react` sends `'react'`), so the devtools identify this binding correctly.
- Realtime reconnects and token refreshes use the latest `getToken` and adapter supplied to the hook; upstream @tanstack/ai-react 0.17.0 captures the first render's callbacks.
- The declared realtime `onStatusChange` callback is invoked alongside the hook's state update; upstream @tanstack/ai-react 0.17.0 currently drops the external callback.
- Changing `useChat`'s connection or fetcher updates the active ChatClient in place and preserves conversation state; upstream @tanstack/ai-react 0.17.0 captures the initial transport.
- One upstream `useChat` test case ("auto-resume on mount / when the browser comes back online") is omitted: it targets `ChatClient.prototype.maybeAutoResume`, an API absent from the pinned (and latest published) `@tanstack/ai-client@0.21.0` and never invoked by `useChat`. It is untestable in this binding until that dependency ships the method.

SSR / hydration: Supported and tested: useChat renders its initial message snapshot through octane/server without a DOM.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-16.

- Hook modules are authored as TSRX with checked declaration companions; no ported hook renders JSX or references React types in its public signature.
- 143 tanstack-ai tests plus 1 SSR test pass, reusing the upstream behavioral tests with no skipped, todo, or expected-failure cases.
- Differential coverage runs one shared chat fixture through this binding and real @tanstack/ai-react@0.17.0, comparing streamed output after each step; output is byte-equal.

## @octanejs/tanstack-devtools

[`packages/tanstack-devtools`](../packages/tanstack-devtools) `0.0.3` — ports `@tanstack/react-devtools@0.10.7`. Status data: [`packages/tanstack-devtools/status.json`](../packages/tanstack-devtools/status.json).

Ports the @tanstack/react-devtools 0.10.7 public surface (the `TanStackDevtools` component plus its plugin/init types) onto Octane while reusing the framework-agnostic `@tanstack/devtools` 0.12.5 core (`TanStackDevtoolsCore`) unchanged. Plugin, title, and custom-trigger content authored as Octane elements is portaled into the containers the core creates.

Known divergences:

- Public adapter types use Octane-prefixed names: `TanStackDevtoolsOctanePlugin` and `TanStackDevtoolsOctaneInit` (upstream: `TanStackDevtoolsReactPlugin` / `TanStackDevtoolsReactInit`).
- `ref` is the normal React-19-style ref prop and events are native (no synthetic layer), consistent with the rest of the Octane bindings.
- The main entry also re-exports the framework-agnostic `@tanstack/devtools` core surface (`TanStackDevtoolsCore`, container-id constants, and plugin authoring types) so consumers do not need a direct dependency on `@tanstack/devtools` for typing plugins.
- Plugin/title/trigger content is rendered through a tiny `DevtoolsPortal` component (a createPortal VALUE), because Octane renders a returned portal at any position rather than only as a direct JSX child.

SSR / hydration: Supported and tested: the component renders its absolutely-positioned anchor element through octane/server without a DOM; the core is constructed but never mounted server-side (mount is a client-only effect).

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-17.

- The component module is authored as TSRX with a checked declaration companion (`devtools.tsrx.d.ts`).
- Upstream `@tanstack/react-devtools` ships no test suite (its `test:lib` runs `vitest --passWithNoTests`), so there is no upstream behavioral suite to port. Coverage is authored fresh: behavioral tests spy on the core to drive the plugin/title/trigger mapping and assert content is portaled into the core-provided containers, plus SSR and type tests.
- No differential rig: both this binding and the React binding drive the identical Solid `@tanstack/devtools` core UI, so there is no framework-authored output to compare beyond the portaled plugin content the behavioral tests already assert.

## @octanejs/tanstack-form

[`packages/tanstack-form`](../packages/tanstack-form) `0.0.3` — ports `@tanstack/react-form@1.33.2`. Status data: [`packages/tanstack-form/status.json`](../packages/tanstack-form/status.json).

Ports the complete @tanstack/react-form 1.33.2 adapter surface (`useForm`, `useField`, form and field groups, hook contexts and component composition) while re-exporting @tanstack/form-core 1.33.2 unchanged and using @octanejs/tanstack-store for subscriptions.

Known divergences:

- Octane uses native events: text controls call `field.handleChange` from `onInput`; TanStack Form's `onChange` validator and listener option names remain unchanged.
- Octane has no StrictMode double-invoke and always provides `useId`, so the adapter omits StrictMode scenarios and the legacy random-UUID fallback.
- Component registration accepts Octane function components; class components are not supported by Octane.

SSR / hydration: Supported and tested: fields and form subscriptions render their initial snapshots through octane/server without a DOM.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-15.

- Renderer-bearing adapter modules are authored as TSRX and ship checked declaration emits with inline renderer aliases, Octane-prefixed public adapter types, and source-owned recursive contracts.
- The ported React adapter suite has 82 executable behavioral tests with no skipped, todo, or expected-failure cases; upstream compile-time tests cover hook, field, group, and component-composition inference.
- Differential coverage compiles one shared form through this adapter and real @tanstack/react-form@1.33.2, comparing values, validation, array mutations, and reset output after every interaction.

## @octanejs/tanstack-query

[`packages/tanstack-query`](../packages/tanstack-query) `0.1.8` — ports `@tanstack/react-query@5.101.0`. Status data: [`packages/tanstack-query/status.json`](../packages/tanstack-query/status.json).

Complete: 58/58 runtime exports plus the full TypeScript surface; the export surface is byte-identical to upstream in both directions (locked by test), and `@tanstack/query-core` is re-exported verbatim.

Known divergences:

- Suspense integrates via octane's `use(thenable)` rather than throwing a promise (observable behavior matches).

SSR / hydration: `HydrationBoundary` fully ported (incl. streaming `promise`/`dehydratedAt` re-hydration); the SSR/streaming server entries and server-render tests are still open.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-06.

## @octanejs/tanstack-router

[`packages/tanstack-router`](../packages/tanstack-router) `0.1.8` — ports `@tanstack/react-router@1.170.16`. Status data: [`packages/tanstack-router/status.json`](../packages/tanstack-router/status.json).

Code-based routing at full binding parity (2026-07-06 gap-closure sweep): the full Match pipeline, router lifecycle events, the complete read-hook family, full-parity `Link` (preloading, masking, `activeProps`), `useBlocker`/`Block`, `Await`/`defer`, scroll restoration, lazy routes, not-found handling, and search-param validation/middleware — differential-verified byte-equal vs the real `@tanstack/react-router`.

Known divergences:

- Refs are props — `createLink`'s `forwardRef` becomes a `ref` prop.
- No `flushSync` in the `Link` click handler; navigation state updates run synchronously.

SSR / hydration: SSR entries (`RouterServer`/`RouterClient`, `HeadContent`/`Scripts`) not yet ported; no SSR tests.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-06.

- Still open: file-based routing + the codegen plugin, devtools, and the typed public surface (factories/hooks are still `any`).

## @octanejs/tanstack-store

[`packages/tanstack-store`](../packages/tanstack-store) `0.0.3` — ports `@tanstack/react-store@0.11.0`. Status data: [`packages/tanstack-store/status.json`](../packages/tanstack-store/status.json).

Re-exports `@tanstack/store@0.11.0` unchanged and implements the stable React binding surface (`useSelector`, `useAtom`, `useCreateAtom`, `useCreateStore`, `createStoreContext`, and deprecated `useStore`) on Octane hooks.

Known divergences:

- The upstream experimental `_useStore` hook is intentionally omitted; use `useSelector` with `store.actions` or `store.setState` instead.

SSR / hydration: Supported: selectors, writable atoms, and store context read their current snapshots during server rendering; the adapter has no browser-only initialization.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-15.

- Differential coverage runs one shared fixture through this adapter and real `@tanstack/react-store@0.11.0`, covering selectors, comparator bailouts, atom writes, component-created atoms and stores, actions, and context.
- Behavioral conformance coverage additionally checks source replacement, independent call sites, nested provider resolution, subscription cleanup, deprecated `useStore`, and server output; type tests cover all overload families.

## @octanejs/tanstack-table

[`packages/tanstack-table`](../packages/tanstack-table) `0.1.6` — ports `@tanstack/react-table@8.21.3`. Status data: [`packages/tanstack-table/status.json`](../packages/tanstack-table/status.json).

Complete 1:1 port: the framework-agnostic `@tanstack/table-core` (createTable + all feature row models) is reused verbatim; the ~100-line React adapter (`useReactTable`, `flexRender`) is transcribed onto octane hooks, preserving upstream's useState-based state wiring.

Known divergences:

- `flexRender`'s class-component and `react.memo`/`forwardRef` exotic-component branches are dropped — octane has no class components or forwardRef, and octane's `memo()` returns a plain function, so `typeof === 'function'` covers every component.

SSR / hydration: No SSR-specific surface; table-core is pure computation.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-11.

- Column sizing/resizing and pinning/ordering drag interactions are untested-by-interaction (the differential rig has no mousemove driver); their state APIs are table-core computation reused verbatim.

## @octanejs/tanstack-virtual

[`packages/tanstack-virtual`](../packages/tanstack-virtual) `0.1.6` — ports `@tanstack/react-virtual@3.14.5`. Status data: [`packages/tanstack-virtual/status.json`](../packages/tanstack-virtual/status.json).

Complete 1:1 port: the framework-agnostic `@tanstack/virtual-core` (Virtualizer + observers + windowing math) is reused verbatim; the React adapter (`useVirtualizer`, `useWindowVirtualizer`, incl. `useFlushSync` and the experimental `directDomUpdates` surface) is transcribed onto octane hooks, preserving upstream's force-update + flushSync-on-sync-scroll wiring and layout-effect lifecycle.

Known divergences:

- octane's `flushSync` called while a flush is already on the stack degrades to a plain call drained by the ambient flush (re-entrancy guard) — sync scroll notifies dispatched from inside a discrete-event flush land at that flush's boundary instead of nested; consumer-invisible, pinned by a conformance test.

SSR / hydration: SSR-safe: `useIsomorphicLayoutEffect` degrades to `useEffect` without `document`; the first paint windows from `initialRect`/`initialOffset` exactly as upstream. No dedicated SSR tests.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-12.

- Smooth scrolling (`behavior: 'smooth'`) and the default ResizeObserver measurement path are untestable in jsdom (no layout); their code is verbatim upstream/virtual-core. Tests drive rects via the public `initialRect`/`observeElementRect`/`measureElement` options, mirroring upstream's own harness.

## @octanejs/testing-library

[`packages/testing-library`](../packages/testing-library) `0.1.6` — ports `@testing-library/react` (unpinned). Status data: [`packages/testing-library/status.json`](../packages/testing-library/status.json).

`render`/`rerender`/`cleanup`/`renderHook` + `act` over the verbatim `@testing-library/dom` (every query, `screen`, `within`, `waitFor`, `fireEvent`, `prettyDOM`, `configure`), with commit timing wired to octane's scheduler via the dom-library's `eventWrapper`/`asyncWrapper` config.

Known divergences:

- `fireEvent` dispatches real native events — no React remappings (`fireEvent.change` fires a native `change`, not `input`) and no enter/leave/focus double-dispatch.
- Not ported: the `ReactStrictMode` wrapper, `legacyRoot`, and the `onCaughtError`/`onRecoverableError` options.

SSR / hydration: `hydrate: true` adopts octane SSR output via `hydrateRoot`.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-09.

- The reused framework-agnostic core is `@testing-library/dom@^10.4.1`; the ported react-testing-library layer tracks upstream behavior rather than a pinned release.

## @octanejs/three

[`packages/three`](../packages/three) `0.1.2` — ports `@react-three/fiber@9.6.1 (2a528745)`. Status data: [`packages/three/status.json`](../packages/three/status.json).

Technical-preview Milestones 0–10 surface: renderer configuration and the DOM Canvas boundary, compiler ABI and renderer-local Three intrinsic types, catalogue and both extend forms, primitive/args construction, Three prop application, attachment, ordered placement/recreation, retained visibility, lifecycle/ref delivery, ownership-aware disposal, promise-returning HTMLCanvasElement and OffscreenCanvas roots, Octane act/flushSync scheduling, callback-aware unmountComponentAtNode, callable root state, scene/camera/raycaster and resize/DPR/viewport configuration, shadows/colors, one shared frame loop, controlled WebXR loop handoff, context-restore invalidation, compatible/reconstructing HMR, global effects, useStore/useThree/useFrame/useGraph and managed-instance helpers, the ray/pointer event system with DOM sources and custom managers, a keyed useLoader cache with preload/clear and GLTF graph augmentation, retained Suspense/Activity behavior, client Three-to-DOM pending/error projection, same-renderer createPortal targets with state/event enclaves and physical Three event bubbling, client-only Canvas shell streaming and production Vite/Rsbuild hydration adoption with the matching raw Rspack graph split, the explicit-target low-level DOMRegion boundary, a deterministic testing harness, an asynchronously acknowledged structured-clone transport proof, a checked public API/subpath matrix, Three r156/current compatibility lanes, a packed external consumer, real WebGL failure/recovery coverage, and semantic-checksummed renderer and shipped-size benchmarks.

Known divergences:

- Octane owns component execution, hooks, context, scheduling, Suspense, refs, and effects instead of embedding React Reconciler.
- The programmatic root renders an Octane component plus props rather than a React element descriptor.
- The upstream callable store selector remains order-based because dynamic function calls cannot receive compiler slots; compiler-visible useStore(selector) and useThree(selector) preserve Octane's conditional-hook semantics.
- buildGraph omits unnamed mesh and material entries, plus array-valued material entries, instead of publishing empty or undefined keys.
- Removing a pierced prop resets its original nested target; R3F 9.6.1 mistakenly writes that default to the leaf key on the root object.
- Reconstructing a captured or hovered object rewrites nested stored intersections to the replacement; R3F 9.6.1 updates only the outer hover identity and capture-map key, which leaves captured delivery pointing at the retired object.
- Hidden retained Activity subtrees are excluded from recursive raycasts; Three r172 ignores Object3D.visible during raycasting, so R3F 9.6.1 can otherwise pierce a hidden descendant through an interactive visible ancestor.
- Managed and externally leased portal targets are root-scoped and cross-root portal placement is rejected before mutation; this makes the universal target-handle lifetime explicit.
- Root teardown and unmountComponentAtNode callback delivery are synchronous; R3F 9.6.1 defers its registry teardown and callback by 500 milliseconds.
- DOMRegion is an Octane-specific explicit-target Three-to-DOM primitive, not R3F or Drei Html and not the WebXR DOM Overlay API; it intentionally defines no positioning, occlusion, styling, or layout contract.

SSR / hydration: Three scene modules are client-only and Canvas.children is omitted from the server graph. Canvas streams its DOM shell and native fallback, then production Vite and Rsbuild hydration adopt those nodes and create one Three root on the client; raw Rspack proves the equivalent client/server graph split without claiming an application SSR lifecycle. DOMRegion and its reverse-DOM content remain inside the omitted client-only Three scene.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-17.

- The exact behavioral/differential oracle remains three@0.172.0; separate minimum-r156 and current-release lanes validate the advertised three >=0.156.0 peer range with an optional @types/three pair from the matching Three release line.
- The checked-in crosswalk classifies 90 upstream public exports and 157 executable upstream tests with zero unclassified or missing evidence paths; the public export/subpath type matrix and packed external consumer validate the published surface.
- Milestone 9 proves asynchronous acknowledgement, cloned values and handles, rejection/fault semantics, teardown, event scopes, and stale message rejection through a real MessageChannel without sharing a host driver or function props.
- Milestone 10 adds real WebGL creation-failure and context-loss/restoration evidence plus semantic-checksummed Octane/R3F/plain-Three renderer and bundle-size baselines with committed ratio guards; the 100-sample production stability run measures 1,000-mesh mount at 0.98x and retained updates at 1.03x R3F after compiler-leaf and direct-host transaction specialization.
- Milestone 8 proves the low-level DOMRegion reverse boundary without claiming Drei Html or WebXR DOM Overlay compatibility.
- React Native/Expo, R3F 10 WebGPU/TSL APIs, and Drei are outside this package's current compatibility target.

## @octanejs/tiptap

[`packages/tiptap`](../packages/tiptap) `0.0.3` — ports `@tiptap/react@3.28.0`. Status data: [`packages/tiptap/status.json`](../packages/tiptap/status.json).

Complete @tiptap/react 3.28.0 adapter surface across the root and ./menus entries: @tiptap/core re-exports, editor hooks and contexts, the EditorContent portal bridge, compound Tiptap API, ReactRenderer, custom NodeView/MarkView renderers and helpers, BubbleMenu, and FloatingMenu.

Known divergences:

- Subscriptions use Octane's native useSyncExternalStore implementation, so the published binding does not depend on React or use-sync-external-store.
- EditorConsumer is a render-prop compatibility component because Octane contexts do not expose React's .Consumer property.
- Renderer components are Octane component bodies and refs are ordinary props; the React-prefixed public names are retained for TipTap source compatibility without a React dependency.
- NodeViewWrapper consumes its as prop after selecting the host tag; @tiptap/react 3.28.0 also forwards that prop as an invalid DOM attribute.
- BubbleMenu and FloatingMenu handlers receive native browser events rather than React synthetic events.
- ReactMarkView tears down its portal when ProseMirror destroys the mark view, closing a renderer leak present in @tiptap/react 3.28.0.

SSR / hydration: Covered across the complete surface: hooks use null server snapshots and suppress editor construction without a DOM, static NodeView/MarkView helpers render without a DOM renderer, detached menu targets are client-only, and hydration adopts deferred server shells before mounting live custom views and menus.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-17.

- Pinned to the @tiptap/react, @tiptap/core, and @tiptap/pm 3.28.0 release family.
- EditorContent owns one external-store portal registry so custom views preserve context, event ownership, and lifecycle beneath the editor host.
- Package-boundary tests lock the root and ./menus runtime exports plus their client directives to @tiptap/react 3.28.0.
- Behavioral tests use real TipTap editors for lifecycle, custom views, and menu plugins; shared-fixture differential tests compare editor and custom-view behavior with @tiptap/react.
- A real Chromium harness covers caret-preserving input, selection, NodeView dragging, and BubbleMenu/FloatingMenu visibility and positioning.

## @octanejs/visx

[`packages/visx`](../packages/visx) `0.1.3` — ports `@visx/visx@4.0.0 + master@485c035`. Status data: [`packages/visx/status.json`](../packages/visx/status.json).

Complete current Visx 4.x web runtime surface: the exact 35-namespace aggregate, all 40 feature entry points, and the eight public a11y/react, a11y/server, axis/react, scale/react, shape/react, theme/react, tooltip/floating, and voronoi/react subpaths. Released-only packages chord, delaunay, react-spring, sankey, and stats remain directly importable exactly as upstream specifies.

Known divergences:

- Interaction callbacks receive native DOM events through Octane's delegated event system instead of React synthetic events.
- All React class controllers and class-instance refs are replaced by native functional TSRX hooks; Brush intentionally omits upstream's legacy innerRef instance handle.
- Deterministic text metrics and annotation bounds, pure SplitLinePath SVG sampling, and collision-aware estimated wordcloud rectangles replace browser-only measurement/canvas paths so fixed-size output is identical during SSR and first hydration. Font-specific wrapping, browser-specific path length rounding, and pixel-exact d3-cloud packing can differ.
- The react-spring entry point uses a deterministic requestAnimationFrame numeric interpolator rather than spring-physics timing, and Zoom uses native wheel/pointer/touch listeners rather than @use-gesture/react at runtime. Their public Visx props and exports are retained; Zoom imports framework-neutral @use-gesture/core types only.

SSR / hydration: Fixed-dimension primitives, wrapped XYChart series, annotations, text, and wordclouds emit complete deterministic SVG on the server. Real hydrateRoot adoption preserves the same SVG/definition/axis/text/series/annotation/wordcloud nodes without warnings, replacement, or post-effect markup changes; generated IDs, measurement fallbacks, portals, and responsive initial sizes are covered.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-14.

- The released v4.0.0 tag is the differential runtime oracle; current master commit 485c035 adds a11y, chart, kernel, theme, and the nested subpaths before their next registry publication.
- All 258 React-owned component and hook modules ship as TSRX and pass both client and server compiler gates; framework-neutral D3/math/data modules remain TypeScript.
- @visx/demo is a non-importable Next.js documentation/gallery application and @visx/registry is private registry tooling; both are excluded.
- @visx/vendor is upstream dual-module D3 packaging infrastructure; this ESM-first port imports the pinned D3 modules directly and does not expose vendor subpaths.

## @octanejs/zustand

[`packages/zustand`](../packages/zustand) `0.1.8` — ports `zustand@5.0.14`. Status data: [`packages/zustand/status.json`](../packages/zustand/status.json).

Complete 1:1 port: the framework-agnostic vanilla store is reused verbatim; `create`/`useStore`, `shallow`/`useShallow`, the traditional equality-fn variants, and all middleware (persist, devtools, subscribeWithSelector, combine, redux).

Known divergences:

- Unstable selectors (a new reference every render) settle after a bounded number of re-renders instead of hitting React's `useSyncExternalStore` warning loop — still prefer `useShallow`.

SSR / hydration: No SSR-specific surface; no dedicated SSR tests.

Scope/evidence last checked: 2026-07-06.
