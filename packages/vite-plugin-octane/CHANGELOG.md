### Patch Changes

- 2a5f44f: Add compiler-backed deferred hydration with the `Hydrate` component, hydration
  strategies, split-child loading and prefetching, SSR adoption, nested interaction
  replay, and eager CSS retention for deferred chunks in the Vite and Rsbuild app
  integrations.
- a12a3d9: Add the experimental universal renderer foundation: a bundler-neutral registry and filename resolver, static host-plan compiler target, core-owned logical topology and staged transactions, object test driver, and explicit DOM-to-universal boundary.
- 95b3081: Complete the experimental universal client renderer's core composition
  semantics: nested component owners, template directives and spreads,
  transactional renderer events, and statically declared renderer-owned child
  regions in both DOM-to-universal and universal-to-DOM directions. Normalize
  and forward boundary metadata consistently across direct compilation, Vite,
  Rspack, and Rsbuild while preserving authored source maps and normal universal
  HMR, profiling, and parallel-use planning. Add the experimental boundary
  configuration schema and the reverse DOM owner bridge used by compiled child
  regions.
- 1b21731: Keep routed hydration compatible with nonce-only Content Security Policies by
  using canonical native dynamic imports and module-relative production preload
  URLs that ignore authored document bases without duplicating page or
  pre-hydrate module singletons.
- c68562b: Dev-server hydrate entry now maps route entries, layouts, preHydrate, and root boundaries as literal dynamic imports (as production already did), so they load through Vite's import analysis and share module-instance identity with the page's own import chain. Previously the analysis-hidden fallback import fetched timestamp-less URLs after an HMR invalidation, creating duplicate browser module instances (e.g. two app-router singletons) that broke hydration on every reload until the dev server restarted.
- 3445fa6: Add a `requireDirective` option to every bundler integration for mixed-toolchain
  codebases (for example a React app hosting Octane islands via `octane/react`).
  When enabled, Octane compiles only project modules that open with a
  `'use octane'` directive: undirected project `.tsx`/`.ts`/`.js` pass through to
  the host framework's own pipeline (with a warning when they import from
  `octane`), an undirected project `.tsrx` is a build error, and installed or
  linked packages keep their Octane package-manifest decision. Paths routed
  through a different tsrx compiler (for example `@tsrx/react`) can be carved out
  with the integration's `exclude` option — excluded paths are never Octane's in
  this mode, even when a file declares the directive. The directive is purely an
  Octane-compilation ownership marker (not part of the tsrx language), composes
  with `'use client'`, is stripped from compiled output, and is tolerated even
  when the option is off. Client-only classification (`clientReferenceForFile`)
  applies the same ownership gate, so importers never hold a client reference
  for a module whose own transform passes through to the host toolchain.
- 6cfb63d: Report browser-repaired HTML nesting with authored locations during development SSR, and collect module style-map CSS while rendering so server and hydrated layouts use the same styles.

  Negotiate streaming gzip in the built-in Node HTTP transport for eligible SSR and static text responses, including the `octane-preview` path.

- d63b0d0: Extend the experimental universal renderer SDK with prepared host acceptance,
  stable-ID recreation, lifecycle and local callbacks, scoped events, prop
  codecs/resource handles, typed text and intrinsic metadata, and retained
  Activity/Suspense visibility. Add client-only renderer server stubs, omitted
  boundary regions, live-use diagnostics, and stable cross-adapter client
  reference manifests for DOM-shell hydration.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- d173805: Harden buffered and streaming SSR with render-scoped boundary IDs, Node and Web
  backpressure/cancellation, request abort signals, and CSP nonces. Compile and
  bundle `module server` RPC functions, load importable root boundaries across
  development, production, and hydration, validate SSR templates, and preserve
  stream lifecycle through HTML composition.

  Keep async retry caches distinct across control arms, component keys/types, and
  keyed value arrays; rewind discarded render-phase side effects; hydrate streamed
  rejections through their server catch arm with catch-visible primitive,
  plain-object, and Error reasons in collision-free seed metadata; and preserve
  nested segment ordering and boundary-local IDs.

  Update the Vercel output contract for response streaming and adjacent ISR
  configuration, and publish the plugin/adapter with explicit peer, engine, and
  tarball boundaries.

- 4093775: Preserve Vite's standard SPA HTML handling when no `octane.config.ts` exists, so
  the same recommended plugin works for client-only SPAs and routed full apps.
- b41a91a: Add a bundler-neutral Octane compiler and app core, a low-level Rspack 2
  compiler integration, and a full Rsbuild 2 metaframework plugin with routing,
  streaming SSR, hydration, HMR, production client/server builds, preview, and
  adapter support. Keep the existing Vite integration on the same shared core.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 6d332ad: octane.config `adapter` is now the full deploy contract `{ name?, adapt?, serve?, runtime? }`: after the production server build, closeBundle runs `adapter.adapt({ root, outDir, clientDir, serverDir, log })` so an adapter package (e.g. `@octanejs/adapter-vercel`) can restructure the output for its platform (SvelteKit-style). All parts are optional and independent — `serve`/`runtime` keep their existing meanings. `@octanejs/adapter-vercel` is registered as a server-only package: client-side imports of it resolve to the browser stub (which now also covers the octane adapter surface, `vercel`/`adapt`) instead of dragging node builtins into the client graph.
- 8fc8554: Production SSR builds — octane apps now deploy server-rendered instead of SPA-only:

  - `vite build` produces BOTH bundles: hashed client assets in `{outDir}/client` (with the generated hydrate entry bundled into index.html via a static, Rollup-analyzable import map over the routes' entry/layout/preHydrate modules) and a self-contained SSR server at `{outDir}/server/entry.js` (app + octane bundled, only node builtins external; octane.config.ts is compiled in through a config-surface facade so neither the compiler nor vite ride along). The built index.html moves to `dist/server` — it is the SSR template, and leaving it in the static dir would shadow the handler at `/` on filesystem-first hosts.
  - `createHandler` (`@octanejs/vite-plugin/production`) is implemented: it matches RenderRoutes/ServerRoutes, runs middleware chains, and streams via the same `renderToReadableStream` engine dev SSR uses — the rendered body region and the `#__octane_data` payload are byte-identical to dev, so `hydrateRoot()` adopts production responses unchanged (covered by an end-to-end fixture test). Per-route `<link rel="stylesheet">`/`modulepreload` tags come from the client manifest. `server.render: 'buffered'` in octane.config.ts switches to the await-everything `prerender` for hosts that break streamed responses.
  - The server entry exports `handler` (Web fetch) and `nodeHandler` (Node `(req, res)`, for serverless wrappers such as a Vercel Node function), and auto-boots under `node dist/server/entry.js` — with the adapter's `serve()` when configured, else the new built-in Node server (`@octanejs/vite-plugin/node`) serving the client assets with immutable caching for `/assets/*`.
  - `octane-preview` now runs that entry for real (pre-deploy verification) and accepts `--port`.

- 3c56d95: Close the four metaframework gaps the octane website surfaced:

  - `octane()` now accepts `exclude` and forwards it to the bundled compiler, so monorepo / aliased-to-source setups can skip the hook-slotting pass for hand-slot-forwarding binding sources (pnpm symlinks resolve `@octanejs/*` to `packages/*/src`, which the automatic node_modules skip can't see).
  - The dev SSR middleware skips Vite-owned requests (`/@` namespaces, `/__` internals, node_modules, `?import`-style transform queries, and extension-bearing paths that name a real file under the Vite root/publicDir — dotted page URLs like `/docs/v2.0` still SSR) before route matching, so a catch-all `'/*splat'` RenderRoute can SSR a real not-found page without swallowing `/@vite/client` or `/src/*.ts`. `RenderRoute` also takes a `status` (e.g. 404 for the catch-all) applied to the rendered response.
  - `appType: 'custom'` is now only a default: an explicit user `appType` wins, and `vite preview` is left on Vite's own SPA fallback so it can serve the client build (production SSR serving is still Phase 2).
  - RenderRoute components (and layouts) receive the request `url` (pathname + search) alongside `params`, on the server and on the hydrating client, and the new `router.preHydrate` config names a module whose default export the client entry awaits before `hydrateRoot` — the hook an app-level client router uses to commit its match tree so hydration adopts the server DOM. The generated client entry also hides its dynamic imports from Vite's `?import` query injection so the page/hook share module singletons with statically-imported copies.

  Dev SSR now streams: RenderRoutes render through `renderToReadableStream` (shell first, suspense boundaries flush out of order behind it) instead of the buffered `prerender`.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 3431ec3: SSR: the buffered renderers (`renderToString`/`renderToStaticMarkup` in
  `octane/server`, `prerender` in `octane/static`) gain a `RenderOptions` argument:
  `nonce` (CSP nonce stamped on the emitted inline `<style>` tags and the suspense seed
  script — all renderers), plus `signal` (AbortSignal that rejects a suspended render
  when the request dies) and `timeoutMs` (per-render override of the suspense settle
  deadline) on the async `prerender`. `octane/server` now documents which exports are
  the compiler's private ABI and exports the `executeServerFunction` RPC executor the
  vite plugin's dev RPC handler loads via `ssrLoadModule('octane/server')` (previously a
  missing export, so any `module server` call crashed). Wire format is devalue, matching
  `@ripple-ts/adapter`'s client stub: devalue-encoded argument array in, devalue-encoded
  `{ value }` envelope out. See the new `docs/ssr.md` for the full SSR guide and the
  current gaps (streaming, selective hydration, production server build).

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- b3a9191: Rename `hydrate` → `hydrateRoot` and adopt React 18's shape. The hydration entry is now `hydrateRoot(container, <App/>)` — container first — and returns a full `Root` (with `.render()` and `.unmount()`), symmetric with `createRoot`. Previously `hydrate(Component, container, props)` put the component first and returned only `{ unmount }`. After hydration the returned root's `.render()` performs a normal client update against the adopted DOM (no re-hydration). The vite-plugin's generated client entry now imports and calls `hydrateRoot`.
- 43d940d: Exclude `@octanejs/tanstack-query` from esbuild pre-bundling (optimizeDeps.exclude + ssr.noExternal). It ships a `.tsrx` provider component, so — like `octane` itself — its source must flow through the octane `.tsrx` transform rather than being pre-bundled by esbuild.
- cb9ad82: Rename the project from `vyre` to `octane`. The runtime now publishes as `octane` and the Vite metaframework plugin as `@octanejs/vite-plugin`. Identifiers inherited from the Ripple fork were also renamed to Octane (e.g. `setIsRippleActEnvironment` → `setIsOctaneActEnvironment`, the metaframework `ripple()` plugin → `octane()`, and the `ripple.config.ts` convention → `octane.config.ts`). References to the upstream Ripple framework and its `@ripple-ts`/`@tsrx` packages are unchanged.
- fcac573: Unify the server-rendering ABI to props-first, matching the client. A component body is now invoked as `(props, scope, extra)` on the server (it used to be `(scope, props, extra)`). This makes a plain `function Foo(props)` used at a `<Foo/>` site work the same on the server as on the client — including components that return a non-JSX value (a primitive coerced to text, an early return, `null`). SSR markup is unchanged (only the invocation order flipped), so hydration is unaffected. The server layout/page wrappers in the vite-plugin were updated to match.
- 634fd52: Align the SSR API with React and reshape the render result to `{ html, css }`.

  The octane-invented `render(Component, props) → { head, body, css }` is replaced by
  React-aligned entry points:

  - `octane/server` (mirrors `react-dom/server`):
    - `renderToString(element, props?, options?)` — a single synchronous pass; a Suspense
      boundary that suspends renders its `@pending` fallback (no awaiting).
    - `renderToStaticMarkup(element, props?, options?)` — clean, non-hydratable HTML (no block
      or head-adoption markers, no suspense seed script).
  - `octane/static` (NEW subpath, mirrors `react-dom/static`):
    - `prerender(element, props?, options?)` — the await-everything behaviour of the old
      `render()`: all Suspense data resolves and success arms render, returning complete HTML.

  All three return `{ html, css }`. The separate `head` field is gone — hoisted `<title>`/
  `<meta>`/`<link>` fold into `html` (spliced into `<head>` when the render produced a
  document, else prepended), matching React 19's resource hoisting. `css` remains a distinct
  field (octane has scoped CSS that React core does not). `render` is removed; the vite
  plugin's dev SSR now uses `prerender`.

- b3a9191: Fix the generated client hydration entry for routes with a layout. The layout's `children` ComponentBody was emitted with the old scope-first calling convention (`(s) => Component(s, { params })`), but octane's client runtime invokes a function child props-first as `({}, block, extra)` — so the page received the block as its props and rendered without its route data. The closure now calls `Component({ params }, scope, extra)`.
